ACCEPTANCE OF ANNUAL SHARES AWARDED IN TERMS OF THE DISCOVERY LONG-TERM
INCENTIVE PLAN AND ONCE-OFF AWARDS IN TERMS OF THE DISCOVERY RETENTION LONG-
TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (“LTIPs”)


In compliance with the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, notification is hereby given that
certain executive directors of the Company and directors of major subsidiaries have accepted
annual awards of ordinary shares allocated in terms of the Discovery long-term incentive plan
(“LTIP”), an equity-settled LTIP. These share awards are subject to vesting conditions that include
performance criteria that are aligned to the organic growth methodology of the Group as
outlined in the Company’s remuneration report and vest equally from the 3rd to the 5th
anniversaries of these awards (between 30 September 2023 and 30 September 2025), provided
the necessary vesting criteria have been achieved.

As outlined in the Company’s remuneration report, the Remuneration Committee of Discovery is
also reviewing the Company’s long-term incentive structures at all levels of management to
mitigate the emerging retention risks as a result of the impact of the recent economic slowdown
and the impact of COVID-19 on the compound performance outcomes for vesting of LTIPs.

Following the above review, the Remuneration Committee recently approved a retention
scheme which includes the allocation of once-off equity settled ordinary share awards. The
vesting of these shares is over three years on 30 September 2023 and is similarly subject to
compound performance conditions currently aligned to the organic growth methodology of the
Group and also subject to certain maximum vesting limitations depending on the outcome of
existing LTIP allocations in issue.

The nature of the interest in respect of each of these awards is direct beneficial, subject to
meeting the vesting performance criteria. The transactions have occurred off-market and the
necessary clearances have been obtained.
The combined allocations accepted, which reflect the maximum that can vest depending on
performance conditions, are set out below:

The information has been extracted from the Audited results for the year ended 30 June 2020.

Resilient operating performance during the pandemic; financial strength and strategic relevance going forward

The full-year period to 30 June 2020 was uniquely complex, with the COVID-19 pandemic creating considerable economic uncertainty, market volatility and societal
need, against an already challenging economic backdrop. Discovery's response was focused on three areas: protecting its people, protecting and supporting its clients,
and supporting country efforts in South Africa - underpinned by a disciplined strategy to maintain Group financial strength and resilience.


Financial Performance

Performance over the period was framed by the following key issues:

Operating performance was resilient

For the full year ended 30 June 2020, core new business was up 5% to R19 173 million, normalised operating profit was up 9% to R8 409 million (before providing for
future COVID-19-related impacts, decreasing by 22% after the provision to R6 069 million) and normalised headline earnings decreased by 26% to R3 747 million.
Normalised headline earnings per share (diluted) decreased by 27% to 566.7 cents and headline earnings per share (diluted) decreased by 94% to 44.7 cents.
The following table summarises the position:

                                                                                                            % change
Metrics                                                                                              over prior year

Group normalised profit from operations (before allowing for COVID-19 provision)                                  9%
Group normalised profit from operations (after allowing for COVID-19 provision)                                 (22%)
Group normalised headline earnings                                                                              (26%)
Headline earnings (after economic assumption changes due to long-term interest rates)                           (94%)

Actuarial dynamics also performed well and demonstrated particular resilience during the final quarter of the year. Over the period, South Africa (SA) and the United
Kingdom (UK) experienced severe lockdowns, however lapse experience was contained within Discovery's actuarial assumptions for all businesses, except Discovery
Invest. Claims experience was also better than assumption for all operations, except VitalityLife, where the effects of the pandemic emerged sooner. New business was
curtailed during the various lockdown periods, but the impact was mitigated by increased digital enablement. This was particularly evident in Ping An Health, which
delivered significant growth through its digital channel during China's lockdown period.


A reserve of R3.4 billion was created to cater for all future COVID-19 impacts

The Group provided R3.4 billion for future COVID-19-related impacts on claims and lapses, so the expected effects to December 2021 are fully recognised and reserved
for in the 2020 reporting year. This resulted in a R2.3 billion profit impact, net of discretionary margins. Discovery's own data and insights have been overlaid onto
global and local data to build sophisticated models to consider three scenarios, with the provisions established in the medium scenario, as a prudent best estimate.


Interest rate movements had a R4.8 billion pre-tax effect on headline earnings

In terms of long-term interest rates, the significant movements in positive real rates of return in SA and negative real rates of return in the UK has a significant effect on
policy values and headline earnings, but none on cash flows, solvency or capital in SA; and since the implementation of the hedge strategy - little impact in the UK. The
impact in the period was R3.6 billion for Discovery Life and £60.5 million net of the valuation of the hedge for Vitality Life, with no bearing on operating performance.
These have been normalised out of the Group's financial result.


The growth model performed well, with substantial, planned investment of R2.2 billion into new businesses

In terms of the growth model, the businesses delivered a resilient operating performance. Established businesses saw an increase in operating profit of 15% before the
COVID-19 provisioning at R9.9 billion (reducing to -13% after), with pleasing new business growth. The emerging businesses saw remarkable growth, delivering a
combined profit of R736 million - 74% higher than the prior period. Investment in new businesses was at 26% of normalised operating earnings (before the COVID-19
reserve), compared with 17% in the previous financial year, with these initiatives demonstrating compelling progress. Discovery Bank completed all migrations onto its
platform and was able to fully fund its credit book with deposits; Vitality Invest doubled total funds under management over the recent six-month period; Umbrella
Funds has a strong pipeline of committed funds; and the V1 platform continued to expand into new markets.


The Group focused on capital strength and liquidity

Regarding capital and cash management, the capital metrics remained above target for all businesses, with internal liquidity bolstered for key businesses. The Group's
Financial Leverage Ratio was at 25.1%(1) and the South African liquidity(2) of R1.9 billion remains above target. These metrics remain resilient into future periods under
the low/stressed COVID-19 scenario.

1 Excludes capitalised lease liabilities under the newly adopted IFRS16 and bank borrowings related to normal course lending and borrowing activities of Discovery Bank
2 South African cash and undrawn committed facilities


The return on embedded value was 2% for the year (5% excluding economic impacts and forex gains), also affected by the COVID-19 provision and other non-economic
methodology and assumption changes predominantly in Discovery Life and VitalityLife.

Heightened relevance of the Vitality Shared-Value business model; continued investment in Discovery's strategic foundation
Discovery is well positioned to respond to the pandemic, given its Shared-Value business model is premised on, and responsive to, three trends being accelerated as a
result of COVID-19. This includes firstly, the behavioural nature of risk, given the emerging importance of healthy living in determining not only non-communicable
disease risk but communicable disease risk as well. Secondly, technology is emerging as a key enabler, given the rush to an online world. Thirdly, there is heightened
demand for purpose-based business models, given the need to find profitable solutions to society's challenges.

The above resulted in continued investment in the model, strengthened by its ongoing recognition and adoption, and by the data supporting its efficacy across
industries. This manifested in developments across the business model's value chain (attraction, conversion, pricing, behaviour change, retention) including the
following: development of a Resilience Index, linking Vitality engagement to the risk of COVID-19 complications; the continued roll-out of Discovery's integrated
capabilities to the global market, courtesy of its V1 platform; the evolution of Discovery Health's leading digital healthcare platform; and AI Quote, an artificial
intelligence quoting tool offering personalised advice to prospective clients.

By leveraging established structures for sharing value combined with sophisticated data tracking and analytics capabilities, the Group was able to rapidly respond to
client needs and provide concessions. Over R750 million was offered to individuals and employers enabling them to continue receiving cover; and a total of R12 billion
was generated in the form of shared value for clients in FY20, spanning premium discounts, cash backs, boosts and value added by managing care.
Business-specific performance

Discovery's Ambition 2023 remains the strategic focus for the medium term, with the goal of being a leading financial services organisation globally, positively
influencing 100 million lives - with 10 million directly insured - and being a powerful force for social good.
Key to achieving this is Discovery's execution of market-specific strategies, namely:

- South Africa: a disruptive composite model, with market-leading businesses and a successful entry into banking
- United Kingdom: a differentiated offering through a composite Vitality Shared-Value business model
- Ping An Health: the leading health insurer in China with over 50 million clients
- Vitality Group: a sophisticated global behaviour-change platform linked to financial services


South Africa

The SA business demonstrated resilience amid the difficult economic and operating environment. Excluding new initiatives, combined new business reduced by 4% to
R12 278 million and operating profit increased by 11% to R8 302 million before the COVID-19 provision (reducing by 3% after). Cash generation across the established
SA businesses was also strong at R5.4 billion and all entities have shown increases in their capital positions.


Discovery Health

Financial resilience

Discovery Health (DH) delivered a strong financial performance despite the challenging period. Normalised operating profit increased by 5% to R3 190 million and total
revenue grew 8% to R8 373 million, with non-scheme revenue showing accelerated growth of 23%. Total new business API decreased by 9% to R6 101 million, affected
by the difficult economic environment and contraction in employment, which translated into a marked year-on-year decline of new business from newly recruited
employees joining existing employee groups. The business continued to tightly control management expenses, resulting in a 1.4% decrease in operational expenses on
a per-member basis (excl. non-recurring COVID-19-related costs). DH made progress in growing non-scheme retail products through Discovery Primary Care, Gap Cover
and Healthy Company, which now account for c.184 000 lives under DH administration and contribute 3% to overall DH revenue.

Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) continued to perform excellently, growing open medical scheme market share to 56.8% in a declining market. The operating
result and solvency were higher than expected as a result of the reduction in health system utilisation during lockdown, which included a 27.5% reduction in hospital
admissions at the end of August 2020. Notwithstanding this higher-than-anticipated surplus, the contribution increase for 2021 must be sufficient to sustain a small
operating surplus and keep up with the utilisation catch-up, in order to mitigate the risk of a high contribution increase for 2022, by which time utilisation is expected to
have recovered fully from the depressed levels due to COVID-19. The surplus built up is thus projected to reverse in 2021 following catch-up of normal non-COVID-19
healthcare utilisation, deferred hospital admissions, a likely muted annual contribution increase and the full year's impact of COVID-19 costs.


Discovery Life

Financial Resilience

Discovery Life (DL) delivered a strong operating performance despite the challenging environment. Claims experience improved significantly compared to FY19,
supporting a 25% increase in normalised operational earnings, pre-COVID-19 provisioning, to R4 029 million (down 8% to R2 971 million after the provision). New
business decreased by 1% to R2 286 million, with strong Automatic Contribution Increases (+10%) and the total in-force premium up by 7%. DL delivered positive
operational experience variances overall and on all key metrics other than policy alterations, given the allowance and take-up of COVID-19 premium relief options and
other buy downs during the lockdown period. The business's financial position remains robust with strong cash flow generation of R2.4 billion, increasing the tangible
free assets to R4.1 billion (both including Discovery Invest) to provide high levels of liquidity. The solvency cover ratio also increased to 182% from 159% at FY19.


Discovery Invest

Financial Resilience

Discovery Invest's performance reflected the challenges of COVID-19 and volatile financial markets. Total Assets under Administration increased by 8% to R99 billion.
Assets under Management increased by 2% to R62.8 billion, with linked funds placed in Discovery funds remaining impressive at 78.3%, down slightly on the prior year
following more conservative investor allocations. Operating profit fell by 14% to R830 million on the back of tax changes, investment in the Invest International launch
and significant sales of Guaranteed Plans during a high period of volatility on the yield curve. Net inflows amounted to R7.6 billion over the period, a decrease of 9.6%,
while new business remained resilient, growing by 2% to R2 667 million.


Discovery Insure

Financial Resilience

Performance was robust over the period, achieving R246 million operating profit (including the share of profit from CMT) - up 59% on the prior year. The Shared-Value
model proposition was evident during this period: enhanced profitability, through reduced claims during lockdown and favourable lapse experience due to better-than-
market client credit profiles, was shared with clients in the form of boosted rewards, to the value of R70 million. New business recovered by year-end to record levels.
Gross Premium Income grew by 14% to R3.7 billion with 6% market share, while gross new business API grew by 5% to R1.1 billion, estimated at between 10% and 15%
market share.


Discovery Bank

Financial Resilience and Operational Progress

Discovery Bank's performance was pleasing, with over 370 000 accounts at end June (489 000 at 13 September) and deposits of R2.4 billion (R3.7 billion at 13
September). Total credit limits granted were R5.5 billion of which R2.0 billion was utilised (R9.6 billion at 13 September with R3.7 billion utilised). The year under review
represented the first year of the Bank's operation. Given the onset of COVID-19, the Bank implemented three strategies, namely; ensuring the successful migration of
over 220 000 Discovery Card accounts from First National Bank to Discovery Bank; pursuing a deposit-led growth strategy, while ensuring the quality of the loan book
and maintaining the quantum spent on the Bank's build within budget; and ensuring rapid learnings from the Shared-Value model to constantly improve the Bank's
user experience and value proposition.

All three strategies were successfully deployed with a system uptime of 99.9%. By the reporting date, the migration was successfully completed and retail deposits
exceeded the loan book, resulting in the Bank having significant surplus liquidity of R3.8 billion and capital strength. The quality of deposits was strong with 65% of
deposits from clients with a Diamond Vitality Money status. The loan book was excellent with arrears 60% lower than market arrears. The Bank's value proposition has
been significantly enhanced via a more accessible Vitality Money experience, more powerful Discovery Miles, and a more intuitive user experience. These
enhancements will be announced at the end of September 2020.


United Kingdom

Financial Resilience

The UK business was affected by the difficult economic and operating environment driven by COVID-19 and persistent low interest rates, among other elements. Over
the period, in respect of the established businesses, combined new business reduced by 12% to £126.3 million (R2 495 million), operating profit increased by 28% to
£93.1 million (R1 840 million) (prior to the COVID-19 reserve, reducing by 61% to £28.2 million (R558 million) after), while total covered lives exceeded 1.3 million, an
increase of 7%.


VitalityHealth

Financial Resilience

VH continued to deliver robust results despite the impact of COVID-19. Operating profit grew 2% to £42.0 million (up 9% to R830 million), which includes the addition of
a significant unearned premium reserve (UPR) set up to better match the earning of premiums with the expected delay in the submission of policyholder claims to
FY21. Operating profit grew 89% to £78.1 million (up 104% to R1 543 million) before setting up this UPR adjustment. New business declined by 15% to £62.7 million (-8%
to R1 238 million) in a challenging sales environment. Despite this, strong retention meant that total lives reached 682 000, up 6%, while earned premiums grew 8% to
£496.8 million (up 16% to R9 813 million), before the additional UPR. The back book was strongly cash flow positive, generating £76.3 million in cash. After new business
acquisition costs and investment in developing the business, VH generated a £57.6 million cash surplus (including the additional UPR).


VitalityLife (VL)

Financial Resilience

VL's normalised operating profit before the COVID-19 provision was 52% lower at £15 million (49% lower at R297 million). After the COVID-19 provision, the normalised
operating loss totalled £13.8 million (R272 million). New business API reduced by 10% to £63.6 million (down 3% to R1 257 million), while earned premiums grew
strongly by 11% to £288.8 million (R5 705 million). Lives covered and in-force policies both grew by 8%, exceeding 621 000 and 470 000 respectively.

Prior to the pandemic, VL faced challenges due to the difficult environment including Brexit uncertainty and persistent low interest rates in combination with challenges
relating to its lapse experience. In response, VL initiated a plan to right-size the business, implemented a hedge for the low and volatile interest rate environment, and
introduced key actions to mitigate lapse risk. COVID-19 introduced additional complexity, which saw VL establish a provision in light of the uncertainty around the
potential impact on claims and lapses over the next 18 months.


Ping An Health (PAH)

Financial Resilience

PAH delivered a solid performance. Total revenue(3) grew by 56% to RMB13.4 billion and new business premium by 33% to RMB6.5 billion. This growth was mainly
driven by strong channel support for its flagship eShengBao product and continued persistency improvements. Sales of this product, which lends itself to online
purchase, did well during the relatively limited COVID-19 lockdown period in China. Profit from operations, represented by the Group's share of after-tax operating
profit less the costs to support the business, grew by 72% to R182 million supported by positive investment returns.

3 Revenue includes policies written on Ping An Health's own insurance license, as well as policies written on Ping An Life's license and directly reinsured to 
  PAH based on the reinsurance treaty terms


Vitality Group

Financial Resilience

Vitality Group (VG) delivered excellent results in a difficult period. Profit of $19.6 million (R308 million) was up 73% from the prior year. Sales showed good progress,
with fee income growing 11% to $72.3 million (R1.1 billion(4)) and insurance partners' integrated premiums reaching $1 billion (R15.8 billion) - an endorsement of the
resilient business model upon which the business is built. Vitality now has a global presence across 24 markets (including the primary markets SA and the UK). Total
Vitality membership grew to 4.1 million, of which 1.5 million are administered on Vitality1, the globally unified systems architecture platform. Membership from
insurance partners' integrated products grew to 1.8 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year.

4 Excludes services related to system implementation and other cost recoveries and rewards


Vitality USA

Vitality USA delivered a pleasing set of results, growing profits 19% from the prior year and membership by 35%. The performance can be attributed in part to a
strategic partnership with Trustmark (an employee benefits company headquartered in Illinois) that drove new business, and changes implemented to optimise the
sales and distribution structures. These strategies are also expected to ensure that the strong performance is sustained going forward and mitigate some of the
challenges expected as a result of COVID-19.

Prospects for growth

Discovery's Shared-Value business model positions it well to deliver continued operational resilience despite the challenging macro environment. Discovery has also
provided for the expected future financial impacts of COVID-19 on claims and lapses to December 2021 during the 2020 financial year. The effect of continued interest
rate volatility is expected to remain a feature of the reported results in the case of Discovery Life, however the hedge in the UK is expected to remove the volatility for
VitalityLife. Solvency, cash and capital are not expected to be negatively impacted by these interest rate movements in SA; and normalised earnings will not be
impacted.

Discovery's Ambition 2023 remains the strategic focus for the medium-term. The Group is well positioned for growth over its planning horizon to 2023, with the capital
plan able to fund its new initiatives. The businesses within the South African composite have created significant insurgency and the composite is well positioned to
continue the SA growth trajectory. The UK composite is embryonic, however the actions taken over the period were key to ensure sustainability in the current
environment and have positioned the business to capitalise in a normalised environment. Vitality Group through capabilities and partnerships is well-placed to leverage
the growing acceptance of the Shared- Value business model. Ping An Health remains committed to investing for longer-term growth, rather than looking to extract
profit or cash in the short to medium-term. Despite the Group's strong capital position, due to the uncertain and potentially volatile economic environment caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic, the Discovery Board has decided not to declare an ordinary dividend for the year ended 30 June 2020.

Further Trading Statement for the year ended 30 June 2020

Shareholders are referred to the detailed trading statement released by Discovery on the JSE Stock Exchange News Service
(SENS) on 15 June 2020 - issued to provide guidance on the potential effect of the COVID-19 pandemic - and relating to the
expected financial performance of Discovery for the full year ended 30 June 2020. Discovery is currently in the process of
finalising its financial year-end results and this trading statement serves as a further update.

Continued operating performance resilience
In line with the guidance previously provided, Discovery expects its financial performance for the year ended 30 June 2020
to be resilient, despite the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during the period:
• Normalised operating profit growth is expected to increase by between 5% and 15%, before the establishment of a
  provision for COVID-19 effects, which are expected to emerge post the reporting period;
• Core new business is expected to increase 4%, with similar trends as reported in the previous trading statement; and
• The overall lapse and claims experience has been resilient for the period, with the performance in June 2020 broadly
  similar to the trends seen in the initial stages of the pandemic, as reported in the previous trading statement.

Significant provision for future COVID-19 effects of approximately R3.3bn, in line with previous guidance
In the previous trading statement, Discovery estimated the expected future cost of the COVID-19 pandemic effect to be
approximately R3.3 billion, based on its central (prudent best-estimate) scenario. Taking emerging data into account,
Discovery remains confident that the R3.3 billion estimate is sufficient to provide for the COVID-19 effect post the reporting
period. The impact on normalised profit from operations is still expected to be partially offset by discretionary margins.

Continued volatility in long-term interest rates in both SA and the UK negatively affecting headline earnings
There were significant movements in long-term interest rates in SA and the UK during the period under review - continuing
from the previous SENS announcement to the end of the reporting period, with negative real rates of return in the UK and
positive real rates of return in SA both at historic levels. This volatility has a significant impact on policy values and headline
earnings, but no impact on cash flows, solvency and capital in SA and, since the implementation of the hedge strategy, little
impact in the UK, and will be normalised out of the Group’s financial results, with it having no bearing on operating
performance. The estimated impact of this provided in the previous trading statement was R3.5 billion but, with continued
volatility to the end of the reporting period, it is now estimated to have a further R1.3 billion impact.

The following table summarises the position.
Table 1: Forecast change over prior year
                                                                                              
Metrics                                                                               Forecast % change        Impact since previous
                                                                                      over prior year          trading update
Group normalised profit from operations before allowing for COVID-19 provision        +5% to +15%              no change
Group normalised profit from operations after allowing for COVID-19 provision         -18% to -28%             no change
Group normalised headline earnings                                                    -20% to -30%             no change
Headline earnings (after the impact of long-term interest rates)                      -90% to -100%            Revised

Shareholders are therefore advised that given the above factors:
• Normalised headline earnings per share are expected to remain within the range of between 20% and 30% lower (to
  between 617.5 cps and 540.3 cps compared to reported 771.9 cps for the prior financial year)
• Headline earnings per share are expected to be between 90% and 100% lower (to between 78.9 cps and 0 cps compared
  to reported 789.0 cps for the prior financial year)
• Basic earnings per share are expected to be between 95% and 105% lower (to between 50.1 cps and -50.1 cps compared
  to reported 1 001.5 cps for the prior financial year)

Discovery's financial results for the year ended 30 June 2020 are due to be released on SENS on 16 September 2020.
The information contained in this announcement, including any estimated or forecast financial information on which this
trading statement is based, has not been reviewed and reported on by Discovery's external auditors.

Trading Statement for the year ending 30 June 2020 and update regarding the COVID-19 pandemic

1.   Preamble: the COVID-19 context

Over the past four months, COVID-19 has caused significant disruption to lives and economies worldwide. As at 14 June
2020, total infections and deaths climbed to over 65,000 and 1,400 respectively in South Africa; 290,000 and 40,000 in the
United Kingdom; and two million and 110,000 in the US. In addition to its health impacts, the pandemic has driven extreme
market volatility, as evidenced by interest rates and equity market movements. For insurers specifically, COVID-19 has
created a uniquely-complex operating and economic environment, with pressure on new business, lapse rates, and potential
future claims; and volatility in interest rates and investment returns.

2.   Financial performance

The financial performance of Discovery for the full year ending 30 June 2020 is expected to consist of:
• A resilient operating performance despite the uniquely-complex COVID-19 environment;
• The creation of a significant provision for expected future COVID-19 effects so that on the Group’s expected scenario
  all claims and economic effects of the pandemic are carried fully in the FY20 year; and
• Materially volatile long-term interest rates in both SA and the UK negatively affecting headline earnings.

In the financial performance commentary that follows, normalised operating profit and normalised headline earnings
exclude the impact of long-term interest rate changes but not the impact of COVID-19 effects. Basic earnings and headline
earnings include the impact of interest rate effects.

The financial performance is summarised as follows:
• New business increased 4% for the eleven months ended 31 May 2020 compared to the prior corresponding period.
• Normalised profit from operations before providing for potential future COVID-19 impacts for the year ending 30 June
  2020 is expected to be between 15% to 25% higher excluding the results of Discovery Bank, and between 5% to 15%
  higher including the results of Discovery Bank.
• Approximately R3.3 billion will be provided for potential future COVID-19 impacts.
• Normalised profit from operations is expected to be between 18% and 28% lower than the prior year, after including
  the potential future COVID-19 impacts.
• Normalised headline earnings is expected to be between 20% and 30% lower than the prior year.
• Headline earnings will be affected by the significant rise in interest rates in South Africa due to COVID-19 and the ratings
  downgrade, and the historically low rates in the UK. Given basic and headline earnings include this effect, these
  measures are very difficult to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty, and could potentially result in a decline of
  those measures between 70% to 90% compared to the prior year.

The following table summarises the position.

3.   Responding to the pandemic: priorities and methodology

The Group’s COVID-19 response prioritised three groups: employees, clients and broader society.
                                                                                                                            
3.1 Protecting employees
Interventions were two-pronged: first, ensuring employee safety, including developing and implementing sophisticated
methodology to identify and protect roughly 2,200 high-risk individuals across SA and UK. Second, balancing employee safety
with business continuity. This involved enabling over 11,000 employees globally to work remotely, with transport and safety
provisions for those deemed essential workers unable to work from home. Throughout, service levels have remained stable.

3.2 Supporting clients
Using Discovery’s data and modelling expertise, interventions focused on identifying members most at risk; and product
innovation across SA and the UK to ensure relevant cover in the current context, while maintaining financial resilience.
Discovery data corroborates published data that the elderly and those with co-morbidities are disproportionately affected;
with emerging evidence that a healthy lifestyle, as measured by Vitality engagement – and formalised in a proprietary
Resilience Index – protects against COVID-19 complications. As a result, more than 30,000 medium to high risk individuals
were identified across the Group, followed by personalised contact. In addition, Discovery enabled employers to further
reach out to their over 100,000 medium to high risk employees.

Innovations included the launch of new COVID-19 specific products (such as the WHO Global Outbreak Benefit and COVID-
19 cash benefit); product enhancements across markets and business lines to cater for COVID-19; and adapting Vitality to
account for the “at home” context (more than 300,000 workouts have been logged online during the COVID-19 crisis in SA
and the UK). Furthermore, the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model lends itself to COVID-19 concessions, by effectively
unlocking financial value contained in future good health; and over R700 million has been offered to individuals and
employers to date.

3.3 Bolstering communities
Discovery leveraged assets and resources towards providing industry support and playing a nation building role. Discovery
has worked closely with the relevant industry and community bodies to share knowledge and expertise; and has extended
access of its digital platform (DrConnect) for free COVID-19 doctor consultations, to all South Africans.

4.   Resilient operating performance amidst a challenging and volatile macro environment

4.1 Actuarial dynamics during the early COVID-19 cycle
While the impacts of COVID-19 are still in the early stages of the cycle, the operating performance of Discovery has been
resilient in volatile and even extreme conditions:
1. The nature of the products is deemed essential. In the case of COVID-19 the need for both life and health insurance has
   increased, and the lapse experience below illustrates the trade-off between essential need and affordability.
2. The specific Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model creates value for both the healthy and sick, thereby creating a stickier
   client base. The integrated nature of the products adds to this stickiness, with the lapse rate differential between clients
   with one product, compared to those with three or more, being more than 60%.
3. The Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model creates unique structures that have been used to offer valuable concessions
   to customers experiencing difficulties - Discovery Life’s Payback Benefit allows clients to unlock the financial value
   contained in their future good health and Discovery Insure’s Vitality Drive enables cash to be refunded based on the
   extent of driving, and has reduced lapse rates dramatically. As mentioned above, over R700 million has been offered to
   individuals and employers to date.
4. Discovery’s client base is weighted towards the retail affluent segment wherein affordability through difficult economic
   conditions is more robust. The average sum assured in Discovery Life is roughly R2.8 million and 87% of clients are
   classified in the highest socio-economic rating class (earning above R50,000 p.m. or having a tertiary degree).

The following table illustrates the effect of these dynamics.

•      Discovery Life’s new business1 held up well in April and May, and lapses have been low, possibly due to the premium
       relief options that have been made available to clients. Total claims were below expectation during the two months,
       and there were less than five COVID-19 related lump sum claims.
•      Discovery Health’s new business growth slowed, due to minimal new employees being added by existing customers.
       Schemes under Discovery Health’s administration experienced much lower withdrawals and claims during the two
       months. The reduction in claims was driven by the postponement of discretionary and elective healthcare procedures,
       which is expected to reverse. COVID-19 related claims are expected for the period.
•      Discovery Insure’s personal lines lapses were much lower than expected, potentially a result of the dynamic pricing
       structure that was introduced. However as expected, motor downgrades increased during the two months. Motor
       claims were significantly below expectation, but should return to normal levels as lockdown restrictions ease.
•      Discovery Invest saw an increase in paid-up policies during the two months, but funds were sticky with withdrawals
       much lower than expected.
•      Vitality Health saw lower lapses than expected, potentially also a result of the premium relief products that were
       introduced. Similar to Discovery Health, it experienced much lower claims due to the postponement of elective
       treatment as well as the NHS co-opting private hospitals to support patient treatment. Vitality Health intends to reserve
       for this temporary drop in claims volumes given the expectation for claims to be caught up once the pandemic is over.
       This will be included in the Group’s reserve for potential future COVID-19 impacts.
•      Vitality Life lapses showed no sign of increase due to the pandemic, but claims were higher than expected, largely driven
       by COVID-19 related mortality claims as the UK is further in the pandemic cycle.

4.2 New business
Despite the effects of COVID-19 illustrated above, core new business annualised premium income for the Group increased
by 4% for the eleven months ended 31 May 2020, compared to the same period in the prior year. The SA and UK businesses
responded to the social distancing and lockdowns in place with strong digital support for advisors.

Ping An Health saw its strongest sales throughout the COVID-19 period, to some degree benefitting from the lockdown, as
the product can be completed through an online channel, enabling the sales to continue via brokers or direct-to-consumer
through Ping An Health’s own app during the lockdown period.

4  Excludes new initiatives.

5  Excludes new initiatives.

•   SA Composite: Resilient performance across the businesses, with a quick response to COVID-19. Discovery Health in
    particular has increased its spend on servicing and infrastructure to ensure greater support to clients during the early
    stages of the pandemic. Discovery Life’s performance for the eleven months was bolstered by positive experience
    variances across key metrics. Discovery Invest’s revenue is linked to the market value of underlying funds managed –                                                                                                                                                  
    which reduced significantly during March and April 2020, however these have improved more recently. Discovery Insure
    was one of the the first short term insurers to adjust its premiums and rewards criteria for customers driving less.
•   UK Composite: Vitality Health had a strong performance due to claims dynamics explained above. Vitality Life’s
    experience is framed by challenges created by the low interest rate environment that has reduced significantly since
    the Brexit vote, and combined with the emerging COVID-19 environment, the effect is an additive deterioration in the
    claims and lapse experience. As communicated, management have instituted an intense programme to right size Vitality
    Life for this environment which consists of a number of key initiatives to be largely completed by the start of the Group’s
    FY21 year. In addition, provisions are being made in this year for future COVID-19 impacts based on the Group’s prudent
    best estimate COVID-19 modelling scenario, as part of the Group’s overall provision.
•   Vitality Group: Good performance despite a temporary slow-down of insurance partner sales due to COVID-19
    lockdowns. The business is well diversified across geographies, with a significant part of its earnings being USD based,
    and revenue arrangements are a blend of fixed and performance-based fees.
•   Ping An Health: Strong performance driven by the exceptional new business experience.
•   Investment in new initiatives: New initiatives remain a key strategic focus, despite revenue growth expected to be more
    challenging in the period. The Group remains confident about the potential of new initiatives having taken some
    strategic shifts to allow for the different market conditions over the next few periods.
•   Discovery Bank: The migrations of the Discovery Card client base into the Bank have been successful and progressing
    rapidly, with the full migration expected to be completed by end July 2020. The Bank continues to attract new clients
    with its fully digital 24/7 on boarding process – with over 177,000 clients and 330,000 accounts. Deposit growth has
    also continued at a strong trajectory. Discovery Bank has over R2.1 billion in retail deposits. Overall credit utilisation has
    declined during the lockdown and arrears including non-performing loans are still within expectation.

4.4 Approximately R3.3 billion for future potential COVID-19 impacts
Discovery anticipates reserving R3.3 billion for the potential claims and lapse impact of COVID-19 that are projected to
emerge in future periods. This will be partially offset by discretionary margins, with the result that normalised profit from
operations is expected to be between 18% and 28% lower than the prior year. As set out below, the modelling has been
done on a prudent actuarial basis, and is continually being refined by incorporating trends in actual infections and mortality.

The COVID-19 provision has been calculated to estimate the future mortality, morbidity and economic effects of the
pandemic by estimating excess mortality and excess lapses expected to arise in 2021 and 2022 on a variety of scenarios by
setting a stressed, central (prudent best estimate) and light scenario. The central scenario has been used to set the provision,
while the stressed scenario used to test capital and liquidity; the light scenario would result in a material release of provisions
in future years.

In terms of mortality, the key areas of impact are Discovery Life and Vitality Life and the modelling uses the United Kingdom’s
Imperial College studies as a basis for Infection Fatality Rates, in combination with SEIR models based on local observed and
modeled infection reproductive rates to ascertain the duration and impact of the pandemic on the Discovery Life and Vitality
Life insured populations. While the UK is at a more advanced stage of the epidemic than SA, both markets are still subject
to significant uncertainty at this stage, hence a prudent modeling approach has been assumed in both cases.

Excess Health claims in the UK will arise due to the delay of elective surgeries during the COVID-19 period as private hospital
capacity has been co-opted by the NHS. These delayed effects have been modeled and estimated as part of the central
scenario, in addition to claims arising for COVID-19 admissions.

The economic effects were modeled to take account of the economic stresses, particularly on policy lapses, in all of
Discovery’s businesses under the range of scenarios.

In summary, approximately two thirds of the R3.3 billion COVID-19 provision is made up of mortality and morbidity impacts,
with a third from economic impacts. The provision is the aggregate value of these effects expected in 2021 and 2022.

Included in presentation of normalised headline earnings
Although the allowance for the COVID-19 impact is an abnormal provision for future impacts, it is not excluded in the
presentation of normalised headline earnings because it is seen as part of the core operations and will impact future cash
flows.

4.5 The effect of long-term interest rates on IFRS reported earnings
There has been substantial volatility in global markets and in particular, material increases in long-term nominal and real
interest rates in South Africa and low interest rates in the United Kingdom. These result in materially different valuation
rates that are used to discount future cash flows and will emerge as economic assumption changes. For Discovery Life this
impact manifests as a lower discounted value of future cash flows, even though the actual cash flows themselves are not
materially affected. Solvency and liquidity within Discovery Life are not negatively impacted by the higher long- term interest
rates in South Africa.
                                                                                                                                
Based on yields as at 31 May 2020, the impact on profit from operations due to the economic basis change in Discovery Life
would be an approximately R2.7 billion negative effect compared to what it would have been at rates prevailing at the
previous year-end. The effect on the Group’s headline earnings of these interest rate movements will depend on the actual
level of long-term interest rates at the year-end reporting date.

In the UK, Vitality Life’s yield-sensitive back book was protected against further interest rate declines, achieved through a
25-year interest rate hedge that was implemented in October 2019. The hedge reduces cash flow and capital requirement
volatility. The passive interest rate used to discount future cash flows is expected to be reset for the first time at 30 June
2020 and will lead to an IFRS valuation strain in Vitality Life, partially offset by the valuation of the hedge. As communicated
at interims, excluding any basis risk, this would equate to a net negative impact of approximately GBP 40 million for the
financial year.

Excluded in presentation of normalised headline earnings
The recent significant interest rate movements resulted in IFRS valuation strains in respect of Discovery Life and Vitality Life.
Should the observed reference interest rates revert, these valuation strains will reverse. Given there is no bearing on
operating performance, Discovery will exclude the effect in the reported normalised earnings measures. Doing so (excluding
the effect of economic assumptions in the normalised earnings), is directionally consistent with the treatment in IFRS 17
Insurance Contracts, which permits the changes in economic assumptions to be presented in Other Comprehensive Income
(OCI).

4.6 Headline earnings
Shareholders are therefore advised that:
Normalised headline earnings per share (NHEPS) will be between 20% and 30% lower (to between 617.52 cps and 540.33
cps compared to reported 771.9 cps for the prior period).

When including the economic basis changes in headline earnings per share (HEPS) and earnings per share (EPS), the final
outcome is very volatile as it is largely dependent upon movement in the real and nominal interest rates in South Africa
towards the end of the year. Shareholders are further advised that using current estimates of long-term interest rates in
South Africa:
• Headline earnings per share are expected to be between 70% and 90% lower (to between 236.7 cps and 78.9 cps
  compared to reported 789.0 cps for the prior period).
• Basic earnings per share are expected to be between 70% and 90% lower (to between 300.5 cps and 100.2 cps
  compared to reported 1 001.5 cps for the prior period).

4.7 Capital and liquidity
Discovery is confident that the Group is strong under high stress scenarios, with sufficient liquidity and solvency to weather
uncertain conditions. Capital ratios are expected to remain broadly in the same range as December levels, and above
targeted levels, even after the above considerations. The cash buffer is expected to remain within or above the target range,
with minimal recourse to additional debt.

The resilience of the Group was tested by extensive claims and lapse stresses, with deliberately prudent scenarios. Detailed
epidemiological models were deployed to inform actuarial provisions, and to develop a wide range of scenarios both
nationally and for Discovery’s insured population.

4.8 Dividend policy
Due to the uncertain and potentially volatile economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Discovery will not
be recommending the payment of ordinary dividends. The reintroduction of dividends will be considered when appropriate.

5.   Outlook

Despite a very complex and difficult trading environment the Group remains optimistic about potential growth and
continues to build for the future. In particular:
• In a post COVID-19 environment the issues of health, wellness, and resilience are likely to be fundamental and
  Discovery’s Shared-Value Insurance model will be well placed to capitalise on this in the markets in which it operates.
• The provision for expected COVID-19 effects going forward will mean that on the Group’s prudent best estimate
  assumption, strong growth should revert.

It must be pointed out that the operating environment is complex and volatile and scenarios going forward may be worse
than expected, in which case the Group’s growth would be lower than expected. The Group is confident that it maintains
sufficient liquidity and solvency to weather uncertain conditions.

The Group continues to cautiously monitor how the impact of COVID-19 evolves and its impact on trading conditions.
                                                                                                                              
The information contained in this announcement, including any forecast financial information on which this trading
statement is based, has not been reviewed and reported on by Discovery's external auditors.

Robust performance in a complex period with substantial investment in new initiatives and core businesses performing well with the exception of VitalityLife

Financial performance

Over the six months ended 31 December 2019, all of Discovery's established and emerging businesses, with the exception of VitalityLife, produced robust operating
results. VitalityLife was largely impacted by its previously-announced strategic decision to mitigate its exposure to further interest rate declines in the United Kingdom.
In addition, the Group continued its increased investment into new strategic initiatives - with Discovery Bank, VitalityInvest and Vitality1 showing encouraging traction,
and spend fully provided for in the capital plan.

As a result, Discovery's normalised profit from operations decreased by 7% to R3 551 million, headline earnings decreased by 9% to R2 047 million and normalised
headline earnings decreased by 11% to R2 117 million. New business annualised premium income (API) increased by 17% to R11 116 million (and by 5% to R9 523
million excluding Vitality Group and the take-on of new closed medical schemes in Discovery Health).

In terms of the operating model, the established businesses delivered a robust performance, with profit of R4 301 million, 3% higher than the prior period despite the
loss in VitalityLife. The emerging businesses grew strongly, delivering a combined profit of R253 million, 50% higher than the prior period. In addition, the Group
invested R1 003 million in new strategic initiatives, an increase of 81% over the prior period. Spend on new initiatives is weighted towards the first half of the year and
expected to decrease in the second half. Of this spend, 53% was dedicated to Discovery Bank, which is expected to remain the dominant investment going forward.
Performance of cash and capital metrics remained within guidance, with the Group's Financial Leverage Ratio at 24.3%(1) and the cash buffer at R2.5 billion.

1 Excludes capitalised lease liabilities under the newly adopted IFRS16 and bank borrowings related to normal course lending and borrowing activities.

Normalised headline earnings per share (diluted)(2) decreased by 12% to 322.3 cents and headline earnings per share (diluted)(2) decreased by 10% to 311.7 cents.

Ambition 2023 and Discovery's unique foundation

2 The percentage change in the current period is the same for both undiluted and diluted earnings per share.

As previously mentioned, Discovery has set a bold Ambition for 2023, of being a leading financial services organisation globally, positively influencing 100 million lives -
with 10 million directly insured - and being a powerful force for social good. Central to achieving this is Discovery's unique foundation - its core purpose, values, people
and brand, which all inform a recursive R&D agenda that continually refines the Shared-Value model.

Over the period, there was substantial advancement of the Group's R&D agenda, including ongoing development of Shared-Value capability across the Group (Vitality
Money, Active Rewards 2020); industry capability across silos (Bank, corporate productivity and Shared-Value health insurance) and across all aspects of Discovery's
value chain (Vitality D2C, Vitality Running World Cup).

The globalisation of Discovery's Vitality Shared-Value model is being enabled by Vitality1, the globally unified systems platform. Vitality1 is live in nine markets after 18
months of operating, touching two million members and creating efficiencies in rolling out in new markets. Every day the platform logs more than four million workouts
and allocates more than 35 000 rewards.

As mentioned previously, achieving the Ambition will require continued execution of market-specific strategies:

- South Africa: a disruptive composite model, with market-leading businesses and a successful entry into banking
- United Kingdom: a differentiated offering through a composite Vitality Shared-Value model
- Ping An Health: the leading health insurer in China with over 50 million clients
- Vitality Group: a sophisticated global behaviour-change platform linked to financial services

South Africa

Discovery Bank

During the period, focus was on leveraging key strategic advantages to build a retail-heavy bank of scale; demonstrating the efficacy of the Vitality Shared-Value model
in banking and creating an appealing customer proposition; using Discovery's unique data capability; and executing on a lower cost-to-income FinTech infrastructure
- ultimately ensuring the Bank is a composite maker for the Group.

As at 18 February 2020, Discovery Bank had 78 000 clients with 180 000 accounts, nearly half of which had never held a Discovery Card before; deposits had grown
strongly to R1.2 billion; total credit card spend was R2.6 billion and total credit limits granted was R2.5 billion - with over R1 billion in credit facility used. Early member
engagement is positive and the client base is exhibiting appealing spend, credit, arrears and deposit behaviour, better than the performance of the previous Discovery
Card and considerably better than the market. Growth potential is strong with over 200 000 accounts that still need to be migrated from the FNB Joint Venture; and the
activation of Discovery's advisor channels to sell bank accounts in the second half of the year.

Discovery Health

The strategic focus over the period was on sustaining growth in a contracting medical scheme market; managing medical inflation while optimising cost and quality;
reducing administration costs while maximising service; and ensuring the increasing financial strength and competitive position of Discovery Health Medical Scheme
(DHMS).

Discovery Health (DH) delivered a resilient performance, with normalised operating profit increasing by 8% to R1 575 million. Total new business API (including take-on
of new closed medical schemes) grew by 26% to R4 367 million.

New business API (excluding Vitality and the take-on of new closed medical schemes) was affected by the challenging economic environment and slower employment
growth, declining 4% relative to the prior period, though still robust at R3 289 million. Traditional new membership from employees joining DHMS employer group
clients, which has historically characterised DHMS growth, has retracted and is being replaced by individual members joining DHMS in their personal capacity; the ratio
of these sources of growth has thus inverted. DHMS delivered a strong performance, with a projected positive operating result before investment income, and solvency
of 27.3% for the scheme year ending 31 December 2019(3). The average contributions of DHMS are 16.7% lower than those of competitors per unit of healthcare
benefit.

3 Note that the DHMS results remain subject to finalisation through the annual independent audit currently underway

Discovery Life

The strategic focus over the period was on optimising growth and quality of new business; achieving positive operational experience variances; ensuring balance and
correct correlations within the Shared-Value model; and ensuring products have relevance through member value and engagement.

Discovery Life (DL) had an excellent period, growing earnings by 25% to R1 875 million (off a low base) as a result of improving claims experience and pleasing all-round
performance. New business grew 2% to R1 240 million in a declining market, resulting in over 31% market share in the retail affluent risk market - more than double
the next largest competitor. DL performed strongly against EV assumptions with improvement across all non-economic experience such as claims, lapses, policy
alterations and Vitality status experience, leading to a positive overall EV variance in Life and Invest. The business remains well capitalised with an above-target SCR
coverage of 172%, and generated cash in line with plan.

Discovery Invest

The strategic focus over the period was on growing new business and assets under management in a market attracting low inflows; evolving a unique long-term
Shared-Value model in a market experiencing commoditisation and market pressure; and ensuring superior overall financial outcomes for customers.

Discovery Invest's performance was robust in an environment of weakened inflows. Operating profit grew by 7% to R485 million and assets under administration by
16% to R96.7 billion, driven by improved market performance at the end of the period. Over 78% of linked funds were placed in Discovery funds. Net inflows were
strong relative to the industry at R2.3 billion. Sales were affected by the weak inflow environment, seeing new business (including ACIs) declining by 2% to R1 357
million. The Discovery Balanced Fund continued to perform well and was in the first performance quartile in its sector for three, five, and ten years(4). At the end of the
third quarter, Discovery Collective Investments was the sixth highest retail flow taker, excluding money market funds, with a substantial proportion of flows going to
high-margin business.

Discovery Insure

The strategic focus over the period was on quality growth in the mass affluent space and ensuring the integrity of the Shared-Value model so that with duration - profit,
scale and materiality emerge.

Discovery Insure (DI) saw strong growth during the period, achieving R75 million operating profit - up 21% on the prior year. Gross Premium Income grew by 15% to
R1.8 billion while gross new business API grew by 7% to R551 million. Gross Written Premium (personal lines only) market share was estimated at 6%.

United Kingdom

The strategic focus over the period was on pursuing the composite strategy. For the six months, combined new business increased by 12% to £76.4 million (R1 416
million, up 14%) and total lives exceeded 1.29 million, an increase of 12%. Normalised operating profit for VitalityHealth (VH) and VitalityLife (VL) reduced by 52% to
£19.5 million (R361 million) - after the impact of interest rates and the interest rate hedge for VL. The hedged position provides a greater degree of certainty and
enables operating within risk tolerance levels.

VitalityHealth

The strategic focus over the period was on maintaining exceptional quality of new business; delivering personalised healthcare pathways through digital; and ensuring
service quality.

VitalityHealth continued to deliver strong results. Operating profit grew by 9% to £26.7 million (up 11% to R495 million), although new business declined by 2% to £33.1
million (0.5% to R613 million) in a challenging sales environment, characterised by economic uncertainty and aggressive competitor activity. Total lives reached 674 000,
up 12%, while earned premiums grew 9% to £246.5 million (R4 569 million). The results reflect continued strong performance across key business metrics: the lapse
rate and claims performance was stable and costs remained well managed.

VitalityLife

The strategic focus over the period was on stabilising the impact of external factors on the business; addressing non-economic variances through quality of new
business and retention; and right-sizing the business for the environment.

VL new business API grew by 6% to £34.8 million (8% to R646 million), and earned premiums by 12% to £141.4 million (R2 620 million). Lives covered and in-force
policies both grew strongly by 12%, exceeding 605 000 and 458 000 respectively. Operating profit declined to -£7.2 million (-R134 million). This includes a negative
impact of £16 million due to the hedge structure and related impacts, as well as negative lapse experience, resulting in embedded value reducing by 1%.

VitalityInvest

The strategic focus over the period was on new business growth and product development to support this. VitalityInvest (VI) has made substantial progress, with new
business annual premium equivalent (APE) of £8.5 million(5) (R157 million) over the period, equating to month-on-month growth of 17% and total funds under
management of £105.3 million (R1 952 million).

5 APE calculated as single/10 + annual recurring.

Ping An Health (PAH)

The strategic focus over the period was on delivering on PAH's ambition of being the leading health insurer in China; driving quality of new business; and continuing to
invest for growth and scale.

PAH had a remarkable period, with total revenue growing by 56% to RMB5.3 billion (R11.1 billion), and new business premium growing over 27% to RMB2.6 billion (R5.5
billion). PAH exceeded its written premium target of RMB10 billion for the 2019 calendar year. The Group's share of after-tax operating profit grew by 467% to $4.6
million (R68 million). The tax relief on deductible commissions effected in May 2019 resulted in the effective tax rate reducing to 41% for the period (December 2018:
55%).

Vitality Group

The strategic focus over the period was on pursuing global scale, relevance and materiality; ensuring leading IP, technology and data insights to deliver the best
behaviour-change platform and drive unique customer propositions; and having a transformational impact on the business of partners.

Vitality Group (VG) delivered a pleasing set of results for the period, achieving a profit of $7.5 million (R110 million, up 16% from the prior year). Fee income grew to $35
million (R515 million, up 17%), supported by strong growth in insurance partners' integrated premiums, which reached $591.5 million (R8.7 billion). Total Vitality
membership grew to 4.5 million, of which two million are administered on Vitality1. Membership(6) from insurance partners' integrated products grew to 1.8 million, an
increase of 63% on the prior year.

6 Full Vitality membership.

Priorities for growth

The Group is well positioned for growth over its planning horizon to 2023, with the capital plan intact. Key priority areas are:

1. Execute on VitalityLife's stated plans to manage in the low interest rate environment, stabilise experience variances and return to robust profit in FY 2021
2. Achieve significant traction in new initiatives, most notably Discovery Bank, and ensure short-term new business thresholds are achieved for each initiative
3. Ensure the established businesses retain their insurgency
4. Capitalise on emerging businesses' unique attributes and positioning to achieve scale and materiality

VOLUNTARY TRADING STATEMENT: SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

Over the six months ended 31 December 2019 (""current period""), all of Discovery's established and
emerging businesses, with the exception of VitalityLife, produced robust operating results. VitalityLife was
largely impacted by its previously announced strategic decision to mitigate its exposure to further interest
rate declines in the United Kingdom. In addition, the Group has continued its budgeted increased
investment into new strategic initiatives.

As a result, normalised profit from operations for the current period is expected to decrease by between
5% and 10% to between R3 609 million and R3 419 million compared to reported R3 799 million for the six
months ended 31 December 2018 (""prior period"") and the Group's normalised headline earnings per share
(diluted) (Notes 1 and 2) for the current period is expected to reduce by between 10% and 15% to between
330 cents and 311 cents compared to reported 366.4 cents for the prior period. Cash, capital and financial
leverage metrics remain well within guidance.

Normalised profit from operations before investment in new initiatives is expected to increase by between
2% and 7% compared to the prior period as per the following reconciliation to normalised profit from
operations.
                                                           Indicative increase / (decrease) in normalised
                                                           profit from key operations for current period
                                                           compared to prior period

 allowing for finance costs)
 Normalised profit from operations                         from -5% to -10%


(*) VitalityLife's result during the current period was impacted by a strategic decision to mitigate its
    exposure to further interest rate declines in the highly volatile, low interest rate United Kingdom
    environment. This was effected by way of an interest rate hedge structure as previously announced.
    This, combined with a generally difficult operating environment in the UK, resulted in VitalityLife
    recording an operating loss for the period, which is a key factor in the higher effective tax rate as
    compared with the prior period.

(**)The group has previously highlighted the continuation of increased investment into strategic
    initiatives including Discovery Bank, VitalityInvest, Vitality1, Umbrella Funds and Discovery Business
    Insurance. Investment spend was budgeted to be higher in the first six months of the year and is
    expected to be lower over the remaining period of the year, further supported by these initiatives
    having gained traction over this period.

Accordingly, shareholders are advised that given the impact of VitalityLife and continuing investment in
new initiatives as described above:
    *    Headline earnings per share (diluted) (Note 1) for the current period is expected to reduce by
         between 8% and 13% to between 319 cents and 302 cents compared to reported 347.2 cents for
         the prior period.
    *    Earnings per share (diluted) (Note 1) for the current period is expected to reduce by between 10%
         and 15% to between 317 cents and 300 cents compared to reported 352.5 cents for the prior
         period.

Discovery's interim financial results for the six months ended 31 December 2019 are due to be released on
SENS on 20 February 2020.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported on
by the Company's external auditors.

Notes:
1 The expected percentage change in the current period is approximately the same for both diluted and undiluted
earnings per share.
2 The expected difference between normalised profit from operations and normalised headline earnings is
predominantly due to an increase in finance costs in line with the long-term capital plan and a higher average
effective tax rate.

CHANGE IN EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTOR

In compliance with paragraph 3.59 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, shareholders are advised
of the following change in executive director responsibilities at Discovery.

Hylton Kallner as CEO of Discovery's South African operations
Mr Kallner, the current CEO of Discovery Life, will assume the role of CEO of Discovery's South African
operations. In the role, Mr Kallner will lead the composite strategy for Health, Life, Invest, Insure, and
Vitality entities, and will oversee their integration with Vitality and Discovery Bank. Mr Kallner will continue
to chair the SA EXCO, as the core governance forum of the SA composite. Given the strategic importance of
Discovery Bank, it will continue to report to the Group CEO.

As a result of the above change in executive responsibilities of Mr Kallner, the following voluntary disclosure
is made.

Riaan van Reenen as CEO of Discovery Life
Mr van Reenen, the current Discovery Life Limited Chief Actuary, will assume the role of CEO and Director of
Discovery Life, subject to regulatory approval. Given his leadership in the development of Discovery Life's
shared-value business model, Mr van Reenen has played a fundamental role in the business's growth from
start-up to the market leader in terms of new business market share and impact. Mr van Reenen has led the
Discovery Life actuarial valuations team since its inception; he has also led the establishment of the actuarial
functions for Group Risk, Discovery Invest and Vitality Life in the UK.

These appointments are seen as an important step to create necessary focus to achieve the Group's
ambition.

INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CHANGES

In compliance with paragraph 3.59 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, shareholders are advised of the
following non-executive director changes at Discovery.

The Company is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr David Macready as independent non-executive director
to the Group Board, effective from 3 February 2020; and as member of the Group Audit Committee, transitioning to
its chairperson with effect from 14 February 2020. Mr Macready will also be appointed as a member of the Actuarial
Committee and Risk and Compliance Committee of the Group.

Mr Macready's membership of the Group Audit Committee will allow for a controlled handover from Mr Les Owen,
independent non-executive director and chairperson of the Group Audit Committee, who has informed the Board of
his intention to retire given his 12-year tenure. This will be effective at the close of the Board meeting scheduled on
14 February 2020.

Appointment of David Macready
Discovery is in an important phase of its development with the recent launch and scaling of its Banking operations,
navigating through a challenging macro-economic environment, as well as its global expansion into different markets
via key partnerships. This requires a unique set of skills and breadth of experience including accounting and actuarial
expertise, together with multinational financial services experience spanning insurance and retail banking; as well as
Board and Audit Committee experience - all within a high-growth and entrepreneurial environment. The Board
believes that Mr Macready's substantial institutional experience is closely aligned to the needs of the Group during
this important phase of its evolution.

Mr Macready (61), a chartered accountant registered with the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants, is a
seasoned professional having commenced his career at Deloitte & Touche in South Africa and a further six years in the
United Kingdom. Mr Macready has spent the past 22 years in the wider Old Mutual Group, more recently being chief
executive officer of Old Mutual South Africa between 2015 and 2017. Mr Macready was chief executive of Old Mutual
Wealth and Investment Group between 2017 and December 2018. Mr Macready also held a number of key
directorships and audit committee memberships within the Old Mutual and Nedbank Group of companies over the
past 12 years.

Discovery welcomes Mr Macready to the Board.

Planned retirement of Mr Les Owen
Mr Owen has served as an independent non-executive director of the Company since December 2007 and has been
chairperson of the Group Audit Committee, as well as a member of the Actuarial Committee and Risk and Compliance
Committee. During his tenure at Discovery, Mr Owen has played a significant role in these important governance and
stewardship roles. Discovery wishes to thank Mr Owen for his invaluable contribution to the Group over the past 12
years.

Mr Owen will ensure a controlled handover to Mr Macready as the new chairperson of the Group Audit Committee.

ACCEPTANCE OF SHARES AWARDED IN TERMS OF THE DISCOVERY LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

In compliance with the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, notification is hereby given that the following executive
directors and directors of major subsidiaries of the Company have accepted the award of ordinary shares in the
Company.

The Discovery Long-term incentive plan (LTIP) which was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting
(AGM) held on 28 November 2019, replaces the cash-settled LTIP with an equity-settled LTIP to align with local
and global best practice in incentivising, motivating and retaining the right calibre of executives and senior
management with the Group. As outlined in the remuneration report of the Integrated Annual Report
(Remuneration report) which was made available to shareholders as part of the AGM notice, the performance
conditions are aligned to the organic growth methodology of the Group and the vesting criteria take account of
the feedback received following shareholder engagement after the 2018 AGM non-binding advisory vote.

Accordingly, the awards accepted by executive directors and directors of major subsidiaries, as contained in this
announcement, will vest from between the 3rd and 5th anniversary of these awards (between 1 October 2022 and
1 October 2024), provided the necessary vesting criteria have been achieved as outlined in the Remuneration
report.

The nature of the interest in respect of each of these awards is direct beneficial, the transactions have occurred
off-market and the necessary clearances have been obtained.

Following a period of medical leave, Mr Herschel Mayers, Executive Director of Discovery and Chief Executive of
VitalityLife and VitalityInvest in the UK, will move from an Executive Role to a Non-Executive role of Vitality in the UK;
and will continue to serve on the Discovery Board, with immediate effect, now as a Non-Executive Director.

Restructure of Health Executives to intensify focus and resource allocation to Discovery's global emerging health
insurance initiatives

Effective 1 January 2020, Dr Jonathan Broomberg, who has been CEO of Discovery Health (Pty) Limited since 2010, will
assume the role of CEO of Vitality Health International (VHI), a new business unit in the Vitality Group International
Inc. Dr Broomberg will also act as Global Head of Health Insurance for the Discovery Group. Dr Ryan Noach, current
Deputy CEO of Discovery Health (Pty) Limited, will be appointed as CEO of Discovery Health (Pty) Limited. This
transition follows an 18 month plan.

Given the considerable growth of Ping An Health and the presence of other opportunities with Discovery's insurance
partners and within specific markets, Dr Broomberg will become the CEO of VHI. Its purpose is to coordinate and
intensify focus and resource allocation to Discovery's global emerging health insurance initiatives. The organisation
believes the opportunities are significant, given the rapid growth of health insurance in most markets around the
world and Discovery's unique health insurance expertise, assets, and shared-value model; together with its
involvement in the preeminent health insurance businesses in South Africa, China and the UK.

In his role as Global Head of Health Insurance for the Discovery Group, Dr Broomberg will play a coordinating role
across all of the health insurance businesses in the Group, and will lead Discovery's health regulatory and policy affairs
globally, including playing an active role in regulatory issues impacting Discovery Health. Dr Broomberg will remain a
Director of Discovery Health (Pty) Limited, and will remain based in Johannesburg.

Dr Ryan Noach will be appointed as CEO of Discovery Health (Pty) Limited. Dr Noach joined Discovery Health in 2008,
was appointed as COO of Discovery Health in 2009 and subsequently as Deputy CEO in 2014. Dr Noach is a medical
practitioner and brings a wealth of healthcare and business experience to his new role, having held various leadership
positions across both the provider and payer side of the Healthcare Industry.

Discovery achieved the following results for the year ended 30 June 2019:

- Headline earnings per share decreased 12% to 789.0 cents per share
- Earnings per share increased 14% to 1 001.5 cents per share

- Profit for the year increased 15% to R6 614 million
- Gross income of the Group increased 15% to R58 863 million
- Diluted embedded value per share increased 7% to R108.30 per share
- Final ordinary share dividends remained unchanged at 114 cents per share

The information has been extracted from the audited results for the year ended 30 June 2019.

Period of considerable complexity, with a temporary decline in profits due to significant investment in new initiatives and large-claim volatility in
Discovery Life

Financial performance

For its 2019 financial year, Discovery planned to increase investment into strategic initiatives significantly, most notably the build and launch of Discovery
Bank, creating an expected reduction in Group earnings(1).

For the first six months to 31 December 2018, this planned increased investment together with an unexpected spike in large mortality claims within
Discovery Life resulted in a substantial reduction in normalised headline earnings per share. Various actions were taken to address the large-claims volatility,
which ameliorated in the second half of the year.

For the financial year ended 30 June 2019, Discovery's normalised profit from operations decreased by 3% to R7 747 million, headline earnings decreased by
11% to R5 147 million and normalised headline earnings decreased by 7% to R5 035 million. Spend on new initiatives increased by 114% to R1 311 million
over the period - 21% of Group earnings (including 3% of associated financing costs) - in line with budget and fully provided for in the capital plan. New
business annualised premium income (API)(2) increased by 13% to R18 299 million, while Embedded Value grew by 9% on an annualised basis to R71 217
million.

Normalised headline earnings per share (undiluted)(3) decreased by 8% to 771.9 cents and headline earnings per share (undiluted)(3) decreased by 12% to
789.0 cents.

Strategic observations

The period under review was one of considerable complexity and the Group's business and operating model ensured a resilient performance in this context.
The strategy over the period reflected the complex environment, and can be distilled into three distinct features:

Focus on growth and prudence:

The disciplined operating model dictates growth through each business phase, whilst ensuring that cash reserves are robust and that the Group is well
capitalised. Guided by this model, there was a focus on organic growth and prudence over the period. In addition to the 21% of Group earnings spent on
new initiatives, the Group's financial leverage ratio improved to 23.3% and the cash buffer increased to R4.4 billion. Further, the Group strengthened its
operating model over the period to include additional prudent constraints to manage the quality and diversity of cash flow.

Disciplined organic growth strategy:

The Group follows a disciplined organic growth strategy guided by the organic growth engine, whereby operating profit growth of CPI +10% is targeted
through a methodical and substantial investment in new initiatives which evolve into emerging businesses, and ultimately scale into established businesses.
Businesses in each phase of the growth engine are tracking well:

i.   Established businesses increased operating profit by 3%. Performance was robust, although impacted by the spike in Discovery Life claims, and business
     fundamentals continued to be strong.
ii.  Emerging businesses are scaling satisfactorily and performed excellently over the period, achieving operating profit growth of 94% to R422 million.
iii. New businesses operated largely within budget, and are gaining traction. The most notable of these was Discovery Bank, which launched for beta
     testing in November 2018 with a public rollout in June 2019. Other important new businesses include VitalityInvest (UK), Vitality1 (the global Vitality
     technology platform), Umbrella Funds (SA) and Discovery Business Insurance (SA).

Evolving the business model and applying it to four focused areas:

Over the period, the science underpinning the behavioural composite model was deepened. A few behaviours explain the majority of the underlying risk
across financial services and these behaviours are correlated. Informed by this science, the composite model consists of a number of different businesses,
where each industry silo (health, life and motor insurance, savings and more recently banking), leverages the same behavioural platform, Vitality. The result is
a compelling value proposition for customers, competitive advantage, a powerful customer platform, and strong behaviour change.

Discovery has set a bold new strategy for 2023 of leading a global transformation of financial services, impacting 100 million lives, with 10 million directly
insured, and being a powerful force for social good. This strategy involves being more deliberate in pursuing composites and manifests in the following
focus areas in each market:

i.   South Africa - a disruptive composite model, with businesses which are market leaders, and a laboratory for Shared-Value in financial services, as well
     as a successful entry into banking
ii.  United Kingdom - a differentiated offering through a composite Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model
iii. Vitality Group - a sophisticated global behavioural platform linked to financial services
iv.  Ping An Health - the leading health insurer in China with over 50 million clients

1.  Normalised profit from operations
2.  Excludes Discovery Health's take-on of new closed medical schemes and gross revenue for Vitality Group
3.  The percentage change in the current period is the same for both undiluted and diluted earnings per share

FINAL ORDINARY SHARE DIVIDEND DECLARATION 
 
In accordance with paragraph 3.11 of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, distribution payments approved by an issuer 
are required to be announced immediately.  Accordingly, notice is hereby given that the board has declared a final gross 
cash dividend of 114 cents (91.2 cents net of dividend withholding tax) per ordinary share, out of income reserves for the 
year ended 30 June 2019 (current financial year).  A dividend withholding tax of 20% will be applicable to all shareholders 
who are not exempt.  
 
This dividend is equal to the final dividend declared in respect of the previous financial year and is consistent with the 
approach followed for the interim dividend in respect of the current financial year.  It reflects a balance between the 
growth reported by our established and emerging businesses whilst recognising the planned increased investment in new 
strategic initiatives.

TRADING UPDATE AND VOLUNTARY TRADING STATEMENT: YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019 
 
For its 2019 financial year, Discovery planned to increase investment into strategic initiatives significantly, most notably 
the build and launch of Discovery Bank, creating an expected reduction in Group earnings1. This has necessitated a more 
detailed trading update for the year ended 30 June 2019.  
 
For the first six months to 31 December 2018 (""half-year""), this planned increased investment together with an 
unexpected spike in large mortality claims within Discovery Life resulted in a substantial reduction in normalised 
headline earnings per share. As explained at the time, Discovery Life has addressed this through various actions, 
including reinsurance structures which reduce the exposure to large-claims volatility going forward as evidenced in the 
second half-year. Investment in strategic initiatives during the second half of the year continued and remained in line 
with budget, albeit above the long-term level of 10%. 
 
For the financial year ended 30 June 2019 (""current year""), Discovery's normalised headline earnings per share 
(diluted)2 are expected to decrease by between 5% and 10% to between 795 cents and 753 cents (2018: 836.9 cents), 
compared to the previous financial year (""prior year""). Core new business annualised premium income (""API"") is 
expected to grow by approximately 13% while the Group's financial leverage ratio (""FLR"") is expected to improve to 
23% and the cash buffer to increase to approximately R4bn. This is as a result of the following: 
 
        
   *   Approximately 20% of Group earnings (including associated financing costs) was spent on new businesses, most 
       notably Discovery Bank, VitalityInvest, Vitality1, Umbrella Funds and Discovery for Business. Spend in new 
       businesses increased by 114% over the prior year.  
   *   Discovery Life's performance largely affected by an unusual spike in high value mortality claims as was fully 
       explained at the half-year. Other key experience metrics remain largely in line with expectation in the second half- 
       year, despite a challenging operating environment.

Other items impacting earnings 
Normalised profit from operations is expected to decrease by between 1% and 5% to between R7 581m to R7 900m (2018: 
R7 980m). The difference between normalised profit from operations and normalised headline earnings was 
predominantly affected by an increase in borrowings which resulted in an increase in finance costs of approximately 
R240m over the prior period, mainly due to funding investment in new initiatives. The Group's headline earnings per 
share2 is expected to reduce by between 10% and 15% to between 809 cents and 764 cents compared to the prior year 
(2018: 899 cents), impacted by movements in deferred tax assets and foreign currency hedges in the current and prior 
year. Basic earnings per share2 is expected to increase by between 10% and 15% to between 963 cents and 1,007 cents 
compared to the prior year (2018: 875.6 cents). This increase in basic earnings includes the previously-disclosed disposal 
and dilution of the Group's interest in Cambridge Mobile Telematics (""CMT"") which resulted in a profit of US$56 m before 
tax as well as an accounting gain, in terms of IFRS 3, on the Group's original interest in the Discovery Card business of 
R761m.   
 

Prospects for growth
Discovery is well positioned for growth, through its robust established businesses, emerging businesses which are scaling 
and expected to grow strongly going forward, and significant new initiatives which are being built. New businesses will 
require investment through their start-up phase, however the c.20% spend on new businesses is expected to decrease 
over the next few years toward the long-term goal of 10% of earnings. Profit growth is expected to return to its stated 
goal of CPI plus 10% and the Group is well capitalised for its five-year planning horizon.  
 
Discovery is supportive of the aims of the recently published National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill in SA, and will work 
closely with the relevant policy makers and stakeholders to ensure an optimal outcome to the legislative process. The Bill 
is not expected to have a material long-term impact on the Discovery Health business and may in fact present new 
opportunities for growth and product innovation.  
 
The lower interest rate environment in the UK is expected to remain an important dynamic for some time and this will 
negatively impact the UK-based VitalityLife business, albeit that a significant component of this impact is unrealised and 
likely to reverse once interest rates normalise.  
 
Discovery's results for the year ended 30 June 2019 are being finalised and are due to be released on SENS on 4 September 
2019. This trading update covers some important elements of the expected results. Whilst Discovery has a reasonable 
degree of certainty that the information contained in this update reflects the outcome for the year ended 30 June 2019, 
it is subject to final review. 
 
The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on by the

TRADING UPDATE AND VOLUNTARY TRADING STATEMENT: YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019 
 
For its 2019 financial year, Discovery planned to increase investment into strategic initiatives significantly, most notably 
the build and launch of Discovery Bank, creating an expected reduction in Group earnings1. This has necessitated a more 
detailed trading update for the year ended 30 June 2019.  
 
For the first six months to 31 December 2018 (""half?year""), this planned increased investment together with an 
unexpected spike in large mortality claims within Discovery Life resulted in a substantial reduction in normalised 
headline earnings per share. As explained at the time, Discovery Life has addressed this through various actions, 
including reinsurance structures which reduce the exposure to large?claims volatility going forward as evidenced in the 
second half?year. Investment in strategic initiatives during the second half of the year continued and remained in line 
with budget, albeit above the long?term level of 10%. 
 
For the financial year ended 30 June 2019 (""current year""), Discovery's normalised headline earnings per share 
(diluted)2 are expected to decrease by between 5% and 10% to between 795 cents and 753 cents (2018: 836.9 cents), 
compared to the previous financial year (""prior year""). Core new business annualised premium income (""API"") is 
expected to grow by approximately 13% while the Group's financial leverage ratio (""FLR"") is expected to improve to 
23% and the cash buffer to increase to approximately R4bn. This is as a result of the following: 
 
        
   *   Approximately 20% of Group earnings (including associated financing costs) was spent on new businesses, most 
       notably Discovery Bank, VitalityInvest, Vitality1, Umbrella Funds and Discovery for Business. Spend in new 
       businesses increased by 114% over the prior year.  
   *   Discovery Life's performance largely affected by an unusual spike in high value mortality claims as was fully 
       explained at the half?year. Other key experience metrics remain largely in line with expectation in the second half? 
       year, despite a challenging operating environment. 
   *   Performance from all of Discovery's businesses as follows:

Other items impacting earnings 
Normalised profit from operations is expected to decrease by between 1% and 5% to between R7 581m to R7 900m (2018: 
R7 980m). The difference between normalised profit from operations and normalised headline earnings was 
predominantly affected by an increase in borrowings which resulted in an increase in finance costs of approximately 
R240m over the prior period, mainly due to funding investment in new initiatives. The Group's headline earnings per 
share2 is expected to reduce by between 10% and 15% to between 809 cents and 764 cents compared to the prior year 
(2018: 899 cents), impacted by movements in deferred tax assets and foreign currency hedges in the current and prior 
year. Basic earnings per share2 is expected to increase by between 10% and 15% to between 963 cents and 1,007 cents 
compared to the prior year (2018: 875.6 cents). This increase in basic earnings includes the previously?disclosed disposal 
and dilution of the Group's interest in Cambridge Mobile Telematics (""CMT"") which resulted in a profit of US$56 m before 
tax as well as an accounting gain, in terms of IFRS 3, on the Group's original interest in the Discovery Card business of 
R761m.   
 
 

Prospects for growth
Discovery is well positioned for growth, through its robust established businesses, emerging businesses which are scaling 
and expected to grow strongly going forward, and significant new initiatives which are being built. New businesses will 
require investment through their start?up phase, however the c.20% spend on new businesses is expected to decrease 
over the next few years toward the long?term goal of 10% of earnings. Profit growth is expected to return to its stated 
goal of CPI plus 10% and the Group is well capitalised for its five?year planning horizon.  
 
Discovery is supportive of the aims of the recently published National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill in SA, and will work 
closely with the relevant policy makers and stakeholders to ensure an optimal outcome to the legislative process. The Bill 
is not expected to have a material long?term impact on the Discovery Health business and may in fact present new 
opportunities for growth and product innovation.  
 
The lower interest rate environment in the UK is expected to remain an important dynamic for some time and this will 
negatively impact the UK?based VitalityLife business, albeit that a significant component of this impact is unrealised and 
likely to reverse once interest rates normalise.  
 
Discovery's results for the year ended 30 June 2019 are being finalised and are due to be released on SENS on 4 September 
2019. This trading update covers some important elements of the expected results. Whilst Discovery has a reasonable 
degree of certainty that the information contained in this update reflects the outcome for the year ended 30 June 2019, 
it is subject to final review.

Voluntary announcement: Discovery's view on the NHI Bill and the future role of medical schemes

The National Health Insurance Bill (""the NHI Bill"") was published on 8 August 2019 and is available on
the website of South Africa's National Department of Health. Discovery believes that the publication
of the NHI Bill creates a very important opportunity for active collaboration between the Department
of Health and the private healthcare sector, to ensure that the assets, skills and experience available
in the private healthcare system are maximally leveraged to ensure the success of the NHI roll out.

Discovery supports the drive towards ensuring that all South Africans have access to quality health
services based on need rather than affordability. Our position on NHI is unequivocal: we are
supportive of an NHI that assists in strengthening and improving the healthcare system for all South
Africans – little is more important. We are committed to assisting where we can in building it, and
making it workable and sustainable.

Our view is that substantially limiting the role of medical schemes would be counterproductive to the
NHI because there are simply insufficient resources to meet the needs of all South Africans - this is an
unavoidable reality. Crucially, by preventing those who can afford it from using their medical scheme
cover, the burden on the NHI will be increased and will drain the very resources that must be used for
people in most need. This would be detrimental to all South Africans, and would undermine the
objectives of the NHI as we understand it.

While this is our view, we are seeking clarity on the potential impact of the NHI Bill on the future role
of private healthcare and medical schemes – and what it means for medical schemes to
provide ""complementary cover "" to the NHI. The NHI Bill makes the point that this ""complementary
role"" for medical schemes will only apply once the NHI is ""fully implemented"" and that it defines
""referral pathways"" to which it will apply, indicating that where patients choose not to follow the
referral pathways, the NHI will not reimburse their care, and that they can then claim from private
health insurance. These elements of the NHI Bill all speak to a continued and important role for
medical schemes, and we will engage actively and constructively to make these points and to ensure
an ongoing critical role for medical schemes and for private healthcare providers as the process goes
forward.

We will actively engage in the forthcoming discussions on the NHI Bill, and we will do this directly, as
well as through the Health Funders Association and Business Unity South Africa. We intend to make
submissions on a wide range of issues raised by the NHI Bill, in the hope of making a constructive
contribution to improving the NHI Bill before it is finally promulgated into law. A key focus area for us
is the future role of medical schemes.

Importantly, we do not envisage any material impact on the medical scheme administration business
of Discovery Health for the foreseeable future. The roll out of the NHI is expected to take place over
an extended period, and will be constrained by the current fiscal position. In addition, as noted above,
the Bill remains open to interpretation regarding its impact on medical schemes, and we expect
medical schemes to continue operating alongside the NHI. We also think that once fully emerged, the
NHI will create additional opportunities for medical schemes to innovate in their products and for the
development of new health insurance products outside of the medical scheme environment.

Commentary

Period of exceptional growth, with a temporary decline in profits due to considerable investment in new initiatives and large-claim volatility in Discovery Life

Headline performance

For its 2019 financial year, Discovery planned to increase investment in new strategic initiatives significantly, most notably the build and launch of Discovery Bank,
creating an expected reduction in Group earnings(1).

For the six months ended 31 December 2018, Discovery's normalised profit from operations decreased by 4% to R3 799 million, headline earnings decreased by 18% to
R2 252 million and normalised headline earnings decreased by 16% to R2 376 million. Spend on new initiatives(2) increased significantly over the period to 21% of
Group earnings (including 3% from the associated financing costs). The spend on new businesses is in line with budget and fully provided for in the capital plan. New
business annualised premium income (API)(3) increased by 16% to R9 049 million, while the Group's financial leverage ratio (FLR) improved to 25% and the central cash
buffer increased to R3.4 billion.

The performance for the period was a manifestation of the planned investment in five new businesses and a strong operating performance from all of Discovery's
businesses, except Discovery Life, which experienced a spike in large mortality claims amounting to 8% of Group earnings for the six-month period. Discovery Life has
altered its reinsurance structures to ameliorate large-claim volatility going forward.

The difference between normalised profit from operations and normalised headline earnings derives predominantly from three factors. As previously disclosed, an
increase in borrowings resulted in an increase in finance costs of R128 million over the prior period, mainly due to funding investment in new initiatives. In addition,
equity and bond market movements resulted in fair value losses of R116 million on shareholder investments (now reported on through profit or loss in terms of the
newly adopted IFRS 9). Lastly, the accounting treatment of the finance lease relating to Discovery's head office (as explained in previous announcements), had a further
increased impact of R55 million net of tax.

For the six-month period, normalised headline earnings per share (undiluted)(4) decreased by 16% to 366.6 cents and headline earnings per share (undiluted)
decreased by 18% to 347.4 cents.

(1) Normalised profit from operations
(2) Excluding JV Card profits
(3) Excludes Discovery Health's take-on of new closed medical schemes and gross revenue for Vitality Group
(4) The percentage change in the current period is the same for both undiluted and diluted earnings per share


Strategic observations

Discovery's core purpose has led to a Shared-Value business model that is applicable, scalable and globally relevant. This underpinned Ambition 2018 (to be the best
insurer in the world and a powerful force for social good), which drove incredible growth across Discovery's businesses. Since setting Ambition 2018 five years ago,
Discovery now touches 21.6 million lives, has a presence in 19 countries, and is using its influence to drive a global movement around behaviour change and wellness.
This is evidenced by its pledge with its insurance partners to collectively make 100 million people 20% more active by 2025.

Discovery has set a bold new strategy for 2023 of leading a global transformation of financial services, impacting 100 million lives, with 10 million directly insured, and
being a powerful force for social good. The Group is more deliberate about pursuing adjacencies and composites and in building the world's largest and most
sophisticated behavioural platform linked to financial services.

Ambition 2023 requires the following:

a) South Africa - the perfect composite model, number one in every industry, and a laboratory for shared-value in financial services
b) United Kingdom - the best insurer in the UK through a composite Shared-Value model
c) Vitality Group - the fastest growing and most global insurtech platform, with limited capital
d) Ping An Health - the largest and most sophisticated health insurer in China

The above is underpinned by the Group's operating model, comprising a strong and profitable base of established businesses, rapidly growing emerging businesses,
and a pipeline of substantial new businesses.

When the above strategies come together, it should result in global presence and relevance.

South Africa - the perfect composite model, number one in every industry, and a laboratory for shared-value in financial services

Discovery Health

Discovery Health (DH) delivered strong results for the period to 31 December 2018, despite a difficult macroeconomic environment. Normalised operating profit
increased by 10% to R1 464 million, new business API increased by 2.9% to R3 420 million (excluding Vitality and the take-on of new closed medical schemes), and lives
under management exceeded 3.5 million. The business continues to grow its market share in both the open and restricted medical scheme markets, and to extract
operating efficiencies through ongoing investment in advanced technologies. Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) continues to show excellence, announcing a
competitive contribution increase of 9.36% for 2019, with average contributions now 16.6% lower than that of competitors on a plan-by-plan basis. The Scheme
achieved a total surplus of R814 million after investment income and year-end solvency of 27.3%, which is above the statutory requirement of 25%.

DH continued investing substantially in risk management assets and systems, quality improvement programmes, an integrated digital technology platform, as well as
data science and artificial intelligence capabilities and systems. These investments are driving significant progress in the expansion of DH's globally unique ""shared-
value health insurance"" model to the benefit of members, and are making a significant contribution to improving operational efficiencies and driving down costs.
DH is committed to being a force for social good by collaborating with health professionals and all other stakeholders to ensure universal coverage within sustainable
public and private healthcare systems, and maintains its support for the principles underpinning the National Health Insurance system.

Discovery Life

Discovery Life (DL) experienced a complex period due to the impact of the Solvency Assessment and Management (SAM) implementation (resulting in a release of 
R3.5 billion of capital to shareholders and hence the associated investment income moving below the line as shareholder income)(5); the basis strengthening in the prior
period; and a spike in high-value mortality claims. This resulted in normalised operating profit reducing by 13% to R1500 million.

While the cost of claims was within premium loadings, skewness was demonstrated by the largest 4.5% of death claims amounting to 38% of the total cost of mortality
claims. The claims experience did not appear to exhibit any material trends by either claims type or duration. Based on this, and similar volatility in previous periods, DL
has altered its reinsurance structures to ameliorate large mortality claims volatility in future. Other aspects of the business performed well: Individual Life new business
sales increased by 14% and lapses and policy alterations performed in line with expectation.

(5) The comparative has been restated to include risk reserve investment income of R118 million below operating profit, to afford better comparability.

Discovery Life's Value of New Business (VNB) measured R480 million - down 3% due to a reduction in Group Life sales. The VNB margin remained unchanged from 
June 2018 at 10.7%.

Discovery Life continues to invest in innovation - both at a product and operational level. Its Bank integrator launched in September 2018 will give clients up to 15%
upfront discount on their Life premiums based on their Discovery Bank account and Vitality Money status. Discovery Life continued to increase its new business market
share in its target market during the period.

Discovery Invest

Discovery Invest's performance was robust amid weak financial markets. Operating profit grew by 9% to R455 million, driven by a 7% increase in assets under
administration to R83.1 billion, with 78% of linked funds in Discovery funds. Net inflows amounted to R3.6 billion over the period. Strong sales of guaranteed products
and single premium endowments pushed new business growth including ACIs to 14%. The focus over the period was refining the use of the Shared-Value model in the
context of long-term savings.

The Discovery Collective Investment Scheme remained in the top 10 retail flow takers while the Discovery Balanced Fund continued to perform well, placing in the first
performance quartile over three years. The business saw continued evidence of positive behaviour change because of the Shared-Value model: duration to retirement
increased by three years; additional ad-hoc investments increased 2.8 times; and withdrawals from linked annuities reduced by 11.5% to be below the industry average.
The Umbrella Retirement Funds product has been well received with a pleasing pipeline of new business.

Discovery Insure

Discovery Insure (DI) saw continued growth in the period, achieving R51 million profit - 325% higher than the prior year period. Gross Premium Income grew by 21% to
over R1.5 billion. The business also launched its new commercial insurance division, attracting strong interest from the intermediary market. Furthermore, SoftBank
Vision Fund invested US$500 million in Cambridge Mobile Telematics (CMT), an associate investment of Discovery and strategic partner to Discovery Insure since 2014.
The transaction will reduce Discovery's effective shareholding in CMT to approximately 10% on a fully diluted basis, and generate approximately US$55 million 
(R780 million) profit for Discovery. As the transaction completed after the reporting period, it will only reflect in Discovery's full-year results.

DI's strategy is centred on the most effective use of technology to deliver shared-value outcomes to clients. Key developments over the period included: the relationship
with global Internet of Things services provider Sigfox through SqwidNet - the Sigfox operator in South Africa - was formalised; collaboration and development
resourcing with CMT was enhanced to continue innovating on the smartphone telematics platform; and key features and processes were added to support Discovery
Insure's CrowdSearch rollout.

DI continued to strengthen the extension of its model into the car rental business through AVIS SafeDrive. The number of SafeDrive sales per day grew by 575% and
there has been a significant reduction in the average damage costs per day of rental cars on Vitality Drive compared to that of a typical rental car.

Finally, the business continues to explore the opportunity to extend the model into international markets as an extension of the Global Vitality Network.

Discovery Bank

Discovery Bank launched in November 2018 for beta testing with a public rollout expected in March 2019. The public launch will be carefully managed, with priorities
being the acceptance of retail deposits and migration of Discovery credit card clients to Discovery Bank. The venture was accelerated with the completion of the deal
with FirstRand Group that sees the Bank now wholly owned by Discovery. In addition, the Bank finalised its restructure and new acquisitions, now owning 100%
economic interest in the Discovery Card Joint Venture. The Bank is now receiving 100% of the Discovery Card JV results.

Discovery Card's performance is 6% less than the same period in the prior year. The decrease in performance is primarily driven by costs on the FirstRand Group
platform increasing at a rate higher than revenue growth. Bad debts as a percentage of advances is 1.56%, which is evidence of the high quality of the book in the
Discovery Card JV.

The Bank's launch to the public is later than originally estimated. Considerable focus has been placed on technology and operational readiness. There is a slight
over-run compared with the original budget but costs are largely in line with expectation and the client offering is significantly enhanced. In addition, attention is
currently on the card migration and retail funding strategies. A successful launch, with a great client experience, is reliant on these interdependent core factors and the
take-on of client volumes will be carefully managed to limit risks.

To end December 2018, a total of R6 billion has been invested in the Bank. This comprises: R3.28 billion paid to FirstRand Group; R1.31 billion regulatory capital
invested in the Bank and R1.42 billion incurred in Discovery Central Services on the build capital expenditure, test capital expenditure and hardware infrastructure. In
spite of some delays, the project has been managed well given the magnitude and complexity of setting up a full digital retail bank.

The best insurer in the UK through a composite Shared-Value model

Vitality UK

Discovery's UK business produced excellent results during the first half of the financial year. Combined new business increased by 13% to R1.2 billion (£66.5 million),
with operating profit growing by 21% to R746 million (£41 million) and total lives growing by 13% to 1.147 million.

Engagement in Vitality reached an all-time high over the 2018 calendar year, with a 45% increase in points-earning activities related to healthy behaviours and high
levels of reward utilisation. The Active Rewards benefit saw particular success, generating 72% of all points-earning activities. Vitality issued its 100 000th Apple Watch
through Active Rewards in January 2019. The period also saw enhancement of the Vitality behavioural platform, with Amazon Prime added as a partner.

VitalityHealth

VitalityHealth (VH) continued the outstanding performance it experienced in the previous financial period. New business increased by 18% to R616 million 
(£33.7 million), with the highly profitable Individual segment increasing by 34% to 58% of total sales. Operating profit increased by 26% to R446 million (£24.4 million),
reflecting continued strong performance across all business metrics: claims performance and lapse rates persisted at historic lows, reflecting the combined effect of
specific claims and retention initiatives, and the selection and retention benefits of Vitality. Costs remained well managed, with reductions in operational costs per life.

During the financial year to date, the VH back book generated excess cash of R853 million (£46.7 million). After new business acquisition costs and investment in
developing the business, a R225 million (£12.3 million) cash surplus was generated.

VitalityLife

VitalityLife (VL) showed steady progress over the period under review, delivering new business API growth of 8% to R600 million (£32.8 million), and operating profit
growth of 15% to R300 million (£16.4 million). The increase in new business volumes was driven by strong growth in direct-to-consumer sales, which now contribute
over 10% of total sales. Despite economic uncertainty, the fundamentals of the business remain strong, with management action taken in the previous period resulting
in significant improvement, with both lapses and claims experience within expectation.

VitalityLife continued its leading innovation by launching a world-first solution to cover the rising costs of later life, including those related to degenerative conditions
such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

VitalityInvest

Launched in June 2018, VitalityInvest brings together behavioural economics, savings and wellness to incentivise people to save sooner, invest for longer, manage their
income drawdown and look after their health. The initial focus has been to educate the broker market on the business's investment platform and the member benefits
of taking out Vitality funds. These incentives are unique in the UK investment marketplace.

In November 2018, VitalityInvest launched its direct-to-consumer offering, and a protector range of funds was launched in February 2019 to meet the customer need
for investment growth, while offering capital protection. The Protector Fund range will initially consist of two funds, both of which will invest in structured products
provided by Investec Bank plc. These new initiatives are launched in advance of the key UK investment season prior to the April tax year-end. Total assets on the
platform are £10.6 million. VitalityInvest marks an important step in building out the UK's composite model.

The fastest-growing and most global insurtech platform, with limited capital

Vitality Group

Vitality Group (VG) made excellent progress over the period, taking two new markets (Sumitomo Life Vitality and AIA South Korea) live on its Vitality1 Platform,
concluding a number of new growth opportunities and seeing strong growth from its more mature markets. Vitality Group profits increased to US$6.7 million 
(R95 million, up 179% from the prior year), driven by maturing operations and strong growth from insurance partners' integrated insurance premiums of US$470 million
(R6.7 billion, up 249% over the prior period). Membership from insurance partnerships increased by 95% to 1.1 million.

Vitality1

The globally unified systems architecture platform has grown to over 800 000 users since it went live in August 2018. This single, standardised, enabling technology
allows Discovery to scale and repeat - and build the largest behavioural platform linked to financial services.

Vitality USA

In its effort to build a broader behaviour-change platform, Vitality Group through Vitality USA joined forces with Aetna, Apple and CVS Health to introduce Attain,
Aetna's new rewards programme. Attain is built off the Vitality model and will be administered by Vitality USA. Vitality USA grew its operating profit to US$1.4 million, an
increase of 34% over the comparative period.

Insurance partnerships

Sumitomo Life Vitality

Since the launch of Sumitomo Life Vitality in July 2018, there has been an encouraging increase in policy count, driven by high-level buy-in from sales agents in Japan.
Sumitomo Life Vitality sales are far greater than historical sales witnessed in any other market at the same stage of operation - a testament to Vitality's widely
successful value proposition and the progress made by Vitality Group in entering new markets.

AIA Vitality

AIA Vitality continues to generate impressive sales of Vitality-integrated products with strong growth in Annualised New Premiums and Vitality membership. With the
rollout of the Vitality1 Platform in South Korea, AIA Korea began offering protection products and AIA Vitality to customers of SK Telecom, a leading telecommunications
service provider with over 30 million customers. The launch has received an encouraging response and a surge in participation in the programme. AIA continues to
explore opportunities to roll out Vitality in more markets across the Asia-Pacific region.

John Hancock and Manulife Vitality

Both John Hancock Vitality and Manulife Vitality demonstrated good growth in revenue, new business and membership numbers over the period. John Hancock
successfully launched Vitality GO in September 2018 (adding Vitality to all its life policies, with a buy up option to full Vitality, called PLUS) and is now working towards
including a version of Vitality on its back book. Enhancement to both the GO and PLUS programmes will continue to aid in the success of the new upsell feature.

Manulife Vitality is on track to deliver Group Benefits in Q1 2019, which will give all of Manulife's employer clients and 1.5 million employees access to Vitality on the
Vitality1 Platform. In terms of retail, programme enhancements such as the addition of the Apple Watch Series 4 and a Hotels.com benefit have seen exceptional
take-up from members.

Generali Vitality

Progress is being made in expanding the distribution channels and Vitality membership grew 79% on aggregate in Germany, France and Austria, despite the sale of
Generali Leben (the primary distribution channel) in July 2018 by the Generali Germany business. Vitality Group foresees potential future growth following the
introduction of Generali Vitality-linked insurance products to the Deutsche Vermögensberatung broker channel in 2018.

Vitality Active

In terms of VG's partnership with Hannover Re to expand Shared-Value Insurance products into next tier markets, the period saw the conclusion of three new
partnerships, bringing the total number of insurers signed to five. Vitality Group is excited about the market launch of IGI Life Vitality in Pakistan in January 2019, which
was well attended by the business community and media. Two more markets are scheduled to launch before the end of 2019.

The largest and most sophisticated health insurer in China

Ping An Health

Ping An Health (PAH) had a remarkable six months with new business premium growing by 117% to RMB2.1 billion (R4.3 billion-100% of new business) with the majority
originating from e-sheng Bao (the internet product).

PAH significantly increased its investment in scaling and automating operations, digitising consumer engagement and growing its sales capabilities and reach. The PAH
app also saw increased investment because of its strategic role in PAH's vision of becoming ""China's leading tech-driven health insurer"". Discovery is excited by the
investment made by PAH to ensure it can achieve its full potential in the Chinese market. Additionally, Discovery invested R36.1 million (an increase of 43% over the
prior period) in projects and expertise to support the growth of PAH, as well as injecting R160 million of capital.

The effect of these investments is a reduction in the short-term margins achieved by the business, in exchange for long-term growth and margin. Therefore, Discovery's
operating profit before tax from PAH grew 26% to R61 million, while revenue grew 84% to RMB3.4 billion (R7 billion). Discovery's share of PAH operating profit (before
Discovery costs) increased to R98 million before tax (a 32% growth from the prior comparative period). As the business scales and matures, it is expected that operating
margins will increase. The extent of investment in digitisation and infrastructure has been validated following the reporting period with PAH taking on 100 000 policies
in a single day in January 2019.

In the 2017 calendar year, PAH used its assessed historical tax losses to offset its taxable income for that period. The effect on 2018 is that the effective tax rate and the
impact of the regulatory tax charge on commissions of over 10% increased significantly. This has reduced the net after tax and Discovery's equity accounted profits
after non-recoverable costs to R12 million, a 66% decrease over the prior period.

In 2018, PAH aggressively expanded its distribution reach across China. Ping An Health has changed its partnership agreement with Ping An Life (PAL) to extend
coverage to more areas not covered by PAH's operating licences. This change has effectively allowed an additional 500 000 PAL sales agents to sell PAH-developed
products. PAH has also been working with the regulators to increase the number of areas where it is licensed to sell its products directly. In 2018, it opened six new
branches and now has 10 branches in megacities (for example, Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen) and eight in smaller cities, giving it access to a population of over 
300 million. PAH plans to open another 10 branches in smaller cities in 2019, which would give it access to an additional ±90 million people.

Vitality Group remains focused on adding value to Ping An Health and is playing a key role in increasing the sophistication of PAH's capabilities in underwriting, pricing,
analytics, and clinical risk management.


Prospects for growth

Discovery's established businesses are well positioned for growth, with Discovery Life expected to revert to target growth levels. Similarly, Discovery's emerging
businesses are expected to grow strongly going forward. Discovery's new businesses will require investment through their start-up phase, however, the 21% spend on
new businesses is expected to decrease over the next few years towards previous levels. Profit growth is expected to return to its stated goal of CPI plus 10% and the
business is well capitalised for its five-year planning horizon.

(1) With the introduction of the Solvency Assessment and Management regulatory regime (SAM) on 1 July 2018, the risk reserve is no longer required to be fully backed
    by tangible financial assets and hence some assets that previously backed positive risk reserves were released into shareholder funds. The classification of
    'Investment income earned on shareholder investments and cash' and 'Investment income earned on assets backing policyholder liabilities' have been restated
    accordingly.

Refer to 'Other significant items in these results' for details on the accounting treatment of Discovery's new head office.

The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) results reflect finance costs and depreciation as required by IAS 17 and the accounting treatment is not
normalised. If normalised headline earnings were to be adjusted for the impact of the accounting treatment of the new head office lease, it would result in an increase
of R102 million (2017: R47 million), net of tax, in normalised headline earnings to R2 478 million (2017: R2 876 million) (decrease of 14% compared to the same period
in the prior year). This adjustment would be calculated by replacing the depreciation of R105 million and finance charges of R178 million recognised in line with IFRS,
with the actual market related rentals of R141 million, and adjusting for tax. Normalised headline earnings per share (with market related cash rentals) would be
382.5 cents per share on an undiluted basis and 382.3 cents per share on a diluted basis.

Fair value hierarchy of financial instruments

The Group's financial instruments measured at fair value have been disclosed using a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy has three levels that reflect the significance of
the inputs used in measuring fair value. These are as follows:

Level 1 includes financial instruments that are measured using unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for identical financial instruments. Quoted prices are
readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly
occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.

Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data. Instruments in this category are valued using:
(a) quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which are not considered to be active or
(b) valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.

Level 3 includes financial instruments that are valued using valuation techniques that incorporate information other than observable market data and where at least
one input (which could have a significant effect on instruments' valuation) cannot be based on observable market data.

                                                                                                                          31 December 2018

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments in level 2

- Discovery has invested in equity linked notes offered by international banks in order to back certain unit-linked contract liabilities. The calculation of the daily value
  of the equity linked investments is made by the provider of the note. Discovery has procedures in place to ensure that these prices are correct. Aside from the daily
  reasonableness checks versus similar funds and movement since the prior day's price, the fund values are calculated with reference to a specific formula or index,
  disclosed to the policyholders, which is recalculated by Discovery in order to check if the price provided by the provider is correct.

- If a quoted market price is not available on a recognised stock exchange or from a broker for non-exchange traded financial instruments, the fair value of the
  instrument is estimated by the asset managers, using valuation techniques including the use of recent arm's length market transactions, reference to the current fair
  value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow techniques, option pricing models or other valuation techniques that provide a
  reliable estimate of prices obtained in actual market transactions.

- The fair value of the hedged derivatives is calculated as follows:
  (a) The fair value of call options is calculated on a Black-Scholes model.
  (b) The fair value of the return swaps is calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the instruments.
  (c) The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.

    The segment information is presented on the same basis as reported to the Chief Executive Officers of the reportable segments. The segment total is then adjusted for accounting reclassifications and entries required to produce IFRS compliant results. These adjustments
    include the following:

(2) The VitalityLife results, for business written on the Prudential Assurance Company license, are reclassified to account for the contractual arrangement as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4.

(1) The inter-segment funding of R339 million reflects a notional allocation of interest earned on the negative reserve backing policyholders' funds of guaranteed investment products and hence is transferred to Discovery Invest.
(2) With the introduction of the Solvency Assessment and Management regulatory regime (SAM) on 1 July 2018, the risk reserve is no longer required to be fully backed by tangible financial assets and hence some assets that previously backed positive risk reserves were
    released into shareholder funds. Investment income on these investments have been restated to include risk reserve interest of R118 million below operating profit, to afford better comparability. This has been presented as R25 million in 'Investment income earned on
    shareholder investments and cash' and R93 million of 'Net fair value gains on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' below operating profit.

    The segment information is presented on the same basis as reported to the Chief Executive Officers of the reportable segments. At each reporting date, Discovery must review whether the segments being disclosed still comply with IFRS8: Segment reporting. In line with this
    assessment at 30 June 2018, the following change was required:

(3) The management control over the credit card operations in the Group has moved from Discovery Vitality to Discovery Bank and disclosed accordingly in the segmental report in ""All other segments"".

    The segment total is then adjusted for accounting reclassifications and entries required to produce IFRS compliant results. These adjustments include the following:

(4) The contractual arrangement, for business written on Prudential Assurance Company's (PAC's) life insurance license (up to 31 December 2015), is reclassified as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4.
(5) The Discovery Unit Trusts (DUT) are consolidated into Discovery's results for IFRS purposes. In the Segment information the DUT column includes the effects of consolidating the unit trusts into Discovery's results, effectively being the income and expenses relating to units
    held by third parties.
(6) The effects of eliminating intercompany transactions on consolidation and normalised operating profit adjustments.
(7) Items disclosed in the various revenue line items have been reallocated to align with performance obligations in terms of IFRS 15. As a result, the prior year figures presented in the segmental report have been restated to include such adjustments. In order to achieve
    comparability with previously reported figures these adjustments are being reversed in the 'IFRS 15 adjustments' column.
(8) The segmental report has been restated to present the accounting treatment of the Head office building in line with the current year disclosure.

New business annualised premium income

The new business annualised premium income (API) set out below provides a view of the scale of new business across all operations of the Group and does not
necessarily reflect the new business attributable to the legal entities within the Group. For instance, Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) new business is
attributable to the medical scheme but is under the administration and marketing of Discovery Health which earns a fee in respect of such services.

(1) The new business API for Closed Schemes includes additional lives on existing closed schemes. The new business API for New Closed

(2) Previously Ping An Health included 100% of the new business API. At June 2018, this has been restated to only include 25% in line with
    the Group's effective shareholding of 25% of this associate. The comparative for December 2017 has been restated accordingly.

Calculation of new business annualised premium income (API)

New business API is calculated at 12 times the monthly premium for new recurring premium policies and 10% of the value of new single premium policies. It also
includes both automatic premium increases and servicing increases on existing long-term insurance policies. The amounts exclude indirect taxes.

The new business API in the table above differs from the new business API disclosed in the embedded value largely as a result of:

  first premium has been received or when the policy is on risk, whereas in the table above, new business is included when the policy has been contractually
  committed.
- Inclusion of automatic premium increases and servicing increases on existing life policies - These are included in the table above but excluded in the embedded value
  API values disclosed.

Refer to the footnotes to Table 7: Embedded Value of New Business for a more detailed description of the differences in new business disclosures between the
embedded value and the table above.

(1) Investment income earned on assets backing policyholder liabilities is accounted for in operating profit while investment income
    earned on tangible shareholder funds are shown as investment income below operating profit. With the introduction of the Solvency
    Assessment and Management regulatory regime (SAM) on 1 July 2018, the risk reserve is no longer required to be fully backed by
    tangible financial assets and hence some assets that previously backed positive risk reserves were released into shareholder funds.
    Investment income on these investments have therefore not been included in operating profit for the current period and the
    comparative has been restated to include risk reserve interest of R118 million in investment income below operating profit, to afford
    better comparability.
(2) The comparatives have been restated to reallocate the DiscoveryCard joint venture and the additional 54.99% DiscoveryCard profit
    share from established businesses to 'Development and other segments'. This restatement was necessary as the management control
    over the credit card operations in the Group has moved from Discovery Vitality to Discovery Bank and disclosed accordingly in the
    segmental report. The Discovery Card joint venture and 54.99% DiscoveryCard profit share amounts to R124 million
    (2017: R124 million).
(3) Strategic initiatives previously included in Vitality Group have been reallocated to 'Development and other segments' as new initiatives,
    as they have evolved into larger opportunities and strategic initiatives across the Group. The comparatives have been restated by
    R33 million. A significant part of this includes Vitality1 which was originally envisaged as a replacement for the legacy Vitality system
    used across the globe. The vision for Vitality1 has evolved into making it the leading behavioural change platform enabling
    shared-value insurance and financial services products across the Discovery Group.

Emerging businesses are those businesses that have achieved sufficient scale to be profitable or profitable in the near future, although not yet significant in cash
generation for the Group and likely to require funds to support new business growth. These businesses are approximately 5 years or more into their launch. Discovery
Insure, excluding commercial insurance, and Vitality Group have been disclosed as Emerging businesses.

Development and other segments include costs of start-up businesses and expenses incurred to investigate, research and develop new products and markets. Start-up
costs include costs in relation to, amongst others, the Discovery Bank, the UK investment business, a commercial offering in Discovery Insure, and an Umbrella Fund
offering in Discovery Invest. Head office costs are also included in this segment.

i.   United Kingdom borrowings

     Discovery previously entered into term facilities totalling GBP 150 million. These borrowings have been used to fund the new business acquisition costs incurred by
     VitalityLife, which were previously funded by The Prudential Assurance Company Limited (Prudential).

     Discovery repaid GBP 50 million of this facility in previous financial periods and a further voluntary prepayment of GBP 10 million on 30 November 2018. The
     balance owing at 31 December 2018 amounts to GBP 90 million (R1 644 million) (30 June 2018: GBP 99.7 million (R1 810 million)).

     Interest rates on these facilities are floating, linked to 3 month LIBOR, payable quarterly in arrears. Finance costs of R21 million (2017: R21 million) in respect of
     these borrowings have been recognised in profit or loss.

        issued further Floating Rate Notes of R700 million, with a coupon interest rate of 10.29% per annum, fixed through an interest rate swap. Interest is payable
        quarterly in arrears and capital is payable in full at maturity on 21 August 2026.

     b. Discovery Central Services Proprietary Limited, a subsidiary of the Discovery Group, entered into a new unsecured R1.4 billion 5 year loan facility in December 2018,
        as part of a broader debt refinancing programme (refer iii below). Interest on this facility has been fixed at 10.60% per annum. Interest is payable
        quarterly in arrears and capital is repayable in full at maturity on 20 December 2023.

     Finance costs of R378 million (31 December 2017: R232 million) in respect of South African borrowings have been recognised in profit or loss.

iii. Redeemable preference shares

     In 2016 Discovery Pref Holding Company (RF) Limited, a subsidiary of the Discovery Group, issued 1 400 A preference shares at an issue price of R1 million each, as
     part of a debt syndication programme. The preference shares were issued at a fixed coupon rate of 8.225% per annum, paid bi-annually, redeemable on 29 June 2021. 
     As part of a broader debt refinancing programme (referred to in b above), these preference shares were voluntarily redeemed on 20 December 2018, at
     nominal value. A breakage fee of R33 million was payable and has been accounted for in finance costs. For the calculation of normalised headline earnings, this
     cost has been added back.

     Finance costs of R58 million (31 December 2017: R58 million) in respect of the redeemable preference shares have been recognised in profit or loss.


Banking

Consistent with Discovery's communication in its annual results for June 2018, the total combined acquisition price payable by Discovery to the FirstRand Group was
R1.8 billion. The concluded transaction included:
- the acquisition of the remaining interest of FirstRand Investment Holdings Limited (FRIHL) in Discovery Bank.
- acquiring the remaining 25.01% economic interest that FirstRand owned in the Discovery Card joint venture.
- Discovery Bank acquiring all rights to the Discovery card book and related assets which will be migrated commencing in 2019.

The transaction received approval from the respective regulatory authorities including the Prudential Authority and the Competition Authorities. The accounting treatment
of these transactions and the impact on the Statement of financial position is summarised below:

                                                                                                     December

i.   DiscoveryCard profit share

     Discovery Bank acquired the remaining 25.01% interest in the DiscoveryCard joint venture business from FirstRand. IFRS 3: Business Combinations requires an
     entity to perform business acquisition accounting from the date on which it obtains control. Any cash flows prior to the date of control are reflected as a
     prepayment.

     In terms of IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements, an investor controls an investee when the investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its
     involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Based on Discovery's assessment of the relevant
     activities that affect the returns of the business acquired, transfer of control for accounting purposes will only arise in the next reporting period.

     Discovery Bank also acquired the 54.99% DiscoveryCard profit share from another subsidiary within the Group. This intergroup transaction resulted in a
     reclassification through a decrease of intangible assets and a corresponding increase in prepayments in contemplation of a business combination.

ii.  Acquisition of FRIHL share of Discovery Bank

     Discovery has acquired the remaining interest in Discovery Bank from FRIHL, being the non-controlling interest. The transaction resulted in Discovery wholly owning
     Discovery Bank. The transaction has resulted in a change of ownership without a change in control. In terms of IFRS, no additional goodwill can be recognised to reflect subsequent
     purchases of additional shares in a subsidiary where there is no change in control. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is
     adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid, is recorded in the statement of changes in equity as a transaction between equity holders in accordance with
     the requirements of IFRS 10.

iii. Funding of acquisition

     The total combined acquisition price payable by Discovery to the FirstRand Group was R1.8 billion. Since this acquisition constitutes a new initiative and presents an
     important opportunity for the Group, the Board decided that this acquisition should be funded by way of an equity issuance limited to the purchase price.

     Discovery raised capital by way of a vendor consideration placement as contemplated in the JSE Listings Requirements and allowed for in its Memorandum of
     Incorporation. This resulted in an increase in capital of R1.85 billion. Costs of R17 million were incurred in respect of the vendor consideration placement and have
     been written-off against share premium. Shares in issue have increased by 11 445 744 shares (9 963 483 shares on 12 November 2018 and 1 482 261 shares on
     29 November 2018) to 658 290 736 shares.

Consolidation of Discovery Unit Trusts

The Discovery Unit Trusts are consolidated into Discovery's results for accounting purposes, which results in the recognition of the underlying assets and liabilities of
each of the funds.

Assets and liabilities of the Discovery Unit Trusts increased by R882 million respectively compared to 30 June 2018, with movements in the following line items on the
Group's Statement of financial position:
- Investments at fair value through profit or loss (policyholder investments) increased by R266 million.
- Investment contracts at fair value through profit or loss increased by R270 million.
- Cash and cash equivalents increased by R392 million.
- Trade and other payables increased by R645 million.
- Other assets increased by R224 million.
- Other liabilities decreased by R33 million.

As these policies are linked, the consolidation of the Discovery Unit Trusts has no impact on the net asset value for shareholders.

There are significant trade volumes in the underlying funds of Discovery Unit Trusts. The cash flow impact of the movement in policyholder investments for the period is included in the
following line items on the Group's Statement of cash flows:
- Purchase of investments held to back policyholder liabilities includes cash outflows of R3.3 billion.
- Proceeds from the disposal of investments held to back policyholder liabilities includes cash inflows of R2.3 billion.


Other significant items in these results

Discovery's new head office

Discovery entered into a 15 year lease agreement for its new head office, which comprises two phases of development. The lease commenced November 2017 and
March 2018 for Phase I and Phase II respectively. Discovery started taking occupancy of the building at those dates, on a phased approach.

IAS 17: Leases, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either a finance lease or an operating lease, at the commencement of the lease term. A lease is classified as a
finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

In terms of the indicators provided in IAS17.10 and IAS17.11, Discovery has classified the lease as a finance lease given that the present value of the minimum lease
payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset. It should be noted that ownership of the building does not transfer at the end of the
lease period but remains that of the landlord.

This accounting treatment has resulted in the recognition of an asset of R3 155 million which has been disclosed in 'Property and equipment' and a corresponding lease
liability, which has been disclosed in 'Borrowings' in the Statement of financial position. The building is depreciated over the lease term, using the straight-line method.
The table below summarises subsequent measurement:

(1) The comparative included only 2 months of charges as the initial recognition date was 1 November on Phase I. Phase II was only recognised in March 2018 and
    hence not included in the comparative number.

The treatment under IFRS 16: Leases, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, would result in a similar treatment with the lease capitalised
and as a result the accounting treatment in respect of this particular lease is aligned with future changes.

Normalised operating profit per the segmental information, reflects the cash rental costs separately from the IFRS finance lease treatment, as individual business
expenses and margins are managed on underlying cash rental costs incurred by each business. The IFRS results reflect finance costs and depreciation as required by
IAS 17.

This accounting treatment is not normalised in normalised headline earnings and has a significant impact during the initial and final stages of the lease. If normalised
headline earnings were to be adjusted for the impact of the accounting treatment of the new head office lease, it would result in an increase of R102 million
(2017: R47 million), net of tax, in normalised headline earnings to R2 478 million (2017: R2 876 million) (decrease of 14% compared to the prior financial year). This
adjustment would be calculated by replacing the depreciation of R105 million and finance charges of R178 million recognised in line with IFRS, with the actual market
related rentals of R141 million, and adjusting for tax.

Taxation

For South African entities that are in a tax paying position, tax has been provided at 28% (2017: 28%) in the financial statements. Where an entity is in an assessed loss
position, a deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that there will be future taxable profits against which assessed losses can be utilised.

Deferred tax

With the promulgation of the South African Insurance Act 18 of 2017, in January 2018, the new 'adjusted IFRS' tax basis is effective 1 July 2018. Deferred tax has been
provided for on the difference between the IFRS and tax liabilities to the extent that timing differences arise.

Recent tax amendments for Life companies introduced a Risk Policy Fund for all new risk business written. In terms of the legislation that was effective 1 July 2016, 
Discovery Life elected to move existing risk business to this fund. As a result, a portion of the assessed loss of R15.7 billion (December 2017: R16.1 billion) in the 
Individual Policyholder Fund is expected to be utilised over time. A value of R491 million (December 2017: R702 million), implicit in the valuation of insurance contract 
liabilities have therefore been recognised as an explicit deferred tax asset in terms of IAS 12: Income Taxes. A corresponding liability has been recognised in 'Liabilities 
arising from insurance contracts'.

The impact on the Income statement for the current reporting period is a decrease in 'Net transfer to/from liabilities arising from insurance contracts' of R87 million
and a corresponding increase in Income tax expense (2017: R140 million decrease in Income tax expense). This has no impact on profit after tax.

Material transactions with related parties

Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS)

Discovery Health administers DHMS and provides managed care services for which it charges an administration fee and a managed healthcare fee respectively. These
fees are determined on an annual basis and approved by the trustees of DHMS. The fees totalled R2 856 million for the six months ended 31 December 2018
(2017: R2 662 million). Discovery offers the members of DHMS access to the Vitality programme.

be held by each of the subsidiaries in addition to their insurance liabilities. The minimum required capital must be maintained at all times throughout the period.

With effect from 1 July 2018 a new insurance regulatory regime, namely Solvency Assessment and Management regulatory regime (SAM), was implemented in South
Africa. Discovery Life and Discovery Insure are regulated under SAM, while Vitality Health and Vitality Life are regulated under the European Solvency II regulatory
regime, which was implemented from 1 January 2016.

Material events after reporting date

Shareholders are referred to the announcement on 20 December 2018 advising that Cambridge Mobile Telematics (""CMT""), an equity-accounted investment of
Discovery and strategic partner to Discovery Insure since 2014, announced a USD 500 million (R7.2 billion) investment from the SoftBank Vision Fund. The transaction was
subject to U.S. regulatory approval which was still outstanding at 31 December 2018.

Upon the completion of the transaction, Discovery's effective shareholding in CMT will reduce to approximately 10% on a fully diluted basis. Discovery's profit from the
transaction will be approximately USD 55 million (R780 million), a portion of which will be realised in cash. This will only be accounted for in the next reporting period.
Discovery Insure's strategic partnership with CMT remains in place following the transaction.

This investment will accelerate the adoption of CMT's DriveWell platform, fueling product and market expansion across insurer and safety solutions.

Accounting policies

The interim results have been prepared in accordance with IFRS including IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting, as well as the South African Companies Act 71 of 2008.
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with the accounting policies applied in the prior Annual Financial Statements, except for the policies described below.

Discovery has adopted IFRS 9: Financial Instruments and IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers from 1 July 2018. Other amendments and annual
improvements to IFRS effective for 1 July 2018 have also been adopted but do not have an impact on Discovery's reported results. Discovery has elected to defer the
hedging requirements under IFRS 9 in line with the provisions of the standard.

As permitted by the transitional provisions of both IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, Discovery has not restated prior year comparative financial statements. Retrospective
adjustments arising from the application of these standards are not included in the financial statement balances at 30 June 2018, but have been adjusted to the
opening balances at 1 July 2018. The notes below present the required transitional disclosures required to understand the changes arising from the adoption of IFRS 9
and IFRS 15.

New accounting standards

IFRS 9: Financial instruments

Classification

IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for the classification of financial assets based on the entity's business model for managing the financial asset and its contractual
cash flow characteristics. An entity is still provided the option to designate a financial asset at initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss if doing so eliminates
or reduces an accounting mismatch. No additional instruments have been designated or de-designated on transition.

Discovery's primary operations relate to long-term insurance and investment services, and as a result hold internal funds to match insurance and investment contract
liabilities that are linked to the changes in fair value of these assets. These assets will continue to be designated and measured at fair value through profit and loss
under IFRS 9.

Shareholder investments were previously classified as Available-for-sale under IAS 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement. This category no longer
exists under IFRS 9. The business model for most of these investments is not to collect contractual cash flows, rather it is to maximise return for shareholders.
Consequently, these investments have been classified as held at fair value through profit or loss. On transition, the balance on the Available-for-sale reserve in equity
has been transferred to retained earnings. Prospectively, gains and losses on these investments will be recorded in profit or loss.

In certain cases balances classified as Available-for-sale under IAS 39 were being held to maturity, it was established that these assets are held in a business model
whose objectives are achieved through collecting contractual cash flows and consequently transferred to the 'Investments at amortised cost' category. Discovery has
not opted to classify any instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments), nor do any financial assets currently meet the business
model required to be held at fair value through other comprehensive income (debt instruments).

Impairment

IFRS 9 introduces a new impairment model which will result in earlier recognition of losses based on the expected credit loss method. The impairment requirements
relate to financial assets measured at amortised cost, contract assets and lease receivables. For Discovery, this relates to items disclosed on the Statement of financial
position as 'Investments at amortised cost' and 'Loans and receivables (including insurance receivables)'. Discovery has assessed these balances for impairment and
raised R83 million for expected credit losses on balances outstanding at 1 July 2018.

Financial liabilities

No changes were introduced by IFRS 9 for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities, except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other
comprehensive income for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, unless the recognition would result in an accounting mismatch, in which case, the
recognition of changes in own credit is recognised in profit or loss.

Discovery has investment contracts which have financial risk, and are consequently recognised and measured in terms of IFRS 9 rather than IFRS 4: Insurance contracts.
These contracts are classified at fair value through profit and loss. The policies are linked to the return on underlying financial assets and are directly matched. The
movement on Discovery's own credit risk is considered immaterial. The remaining financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost.

IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers

IFRS 15 establishes a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to achieve greater consistency in the recognition and
presentation of revenue. Revenue is recognised based on the satisfaction of performance obligations, which occurs when control of goods or services transfer to a
customer.

Discovery's revenue comprises primarily insurance premium revenue which is accounted for in terms of IFRS 4. For non-insurance revenue, Discovery has performed
detailed assessments on underlying contractual arrangements with customers. This included detailed assessments in respect of fee income for investment
management services, fee income from administration business and vitality income. In most cases there is no impact on the timing or amount of revenue recognition.

A R6 million adjustment was processed to the opening balance of retained earnings for a change in the timing of revenue recognition on several contracts. This was not
material to the Discovery Group. Discovery will continue to assess all new contracts entered into for appropriate application of IFRS 15. The disaggregation of revenue is
disclosed in the segment report and in the income statement categories.

(1) Note that there are no changes in carrying amount arising from a changing measurement attribute on transition to IFRS 9. The fair value of the investments
    transferred to amortised cost approximated the amortised cost value, and hence no measurement adjustment was required on transition. The effective interest
    rate on these instruments was between 7.31% and 8.6% and interest income of R56 million was recognised in the current reporting period.

Embedded value statement
for the six months ended 31 December 2018

The embedded value of Discovery consists of the following components:
- the adjusted net worth attributed to the business at the valuation date;
- plus: the present value of expected future shareholder cash flows from the in-force covered business;
- less: the cost of required capital.

The present value of future shareholder cash flows from the in-force covered business is calculated as the value of projected future after-tax shareholder cash flows of
the business in-force at the valuation date, discounted at the risk discount rate.

The required capital are the assets attributed to the covered business above the amount required to back covered business liabilities, whose distribution to
shareholders is restricted as they are allocated to cover regulatory and internal capital requirements.

The value of new business is the present value, at the point of sale, of the projected future after-tax shareholder cash flows of the new business written by Discovery,
discounted at the risk discount rate, less an allowance for the reserving strain, initial expenses and cost of required capital. The value of new business is calculated
using the current reporting date assumptions.

For Discovery Life, the basis for preparing the regulatory balance sheet has changed from the Statutory Valuation Method (""SVM"") to the Solvency Assessment and
Management (""SAM"") basis, with effect from 1 July 2018. As the regulatory balance sheet influences the timing of free cash flow emergence, it has necessitated a change
in the embedded value methodology. As a consequence, negative reserves are no longer zeroised at a per policy level, which implies that policies with negative reserves
can be used to match policies with positive reserves as well as the required capital where appropriate. This effectively results in a transfer of value from value of
in-force to net worth.

In addition, a new tax basis came into effect for South African long term insurance companies on 1 July 2018, which requires the zeroisation of net policyholder
liabilities at a tax fund level. The change has an impact on the timing of the tax payments, but not the overall level throughout the embedded value projection period.
The embedded value includes the insurance and administration profits of the covered business in the Discovery Limited group. Covered business includes business
written in South Africa through Discovery Life (""Life""), Discovery Invest (""Invest""), Discovery Health (""Health"") and Discovery Vitality (""Vitality""), and in the United Kingdom
through VitalityLife and VitalityHealth. For Vitality Group, Ping An Health, MyOwn Health, Discovery Insure and VitaltyInvest, no published value has been placed on the
current in-force business as the businesses have not yet reached suitable scale with predictable experience.

In August 2011, Discovery raised R800 million through the issue of non-cumulative, non-participating, non-convertible preference shares. For embedded value purposes
this capital, net of share issue expenses, has been excluded from the adjusted net worth.

The 31 December 2018 embedded value results and disclosures were not subjected to an external review or audit.

    The excess of available capital over adjusted net worth reflects the difference between the adjusted net worth and the available capital. 
    This includes:
    - The net preference share capital of R779 million which is included as available capital.
    - The difference between Vitality Life Limited's Solvency II Pillar 1 Own Funds and its adjusted net worth, and adds back the negative reserves eliminated on the
      Discovery funded VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence.

    The required capital at December 2018 for Life is R19 673 million (June 2018: R1 732 million; December 2017: R1 584 million), for Health and Vitality is
    R886 million (June 2018: R840 million; December 2017: R778 million), for VitalityHealth is R2 240 million (June 2018: R2 133 million; December 2017: 
    R1 899 million) and for VitalityLife is R5 145 million (June 2018: R4 210 million; December 2017: R3 237 million). For Life, the required capital was set equal to
    management's internal view of the capital required, which is based on a multiple of the estimated regulatory capital requirements. For Health and Vitality,
    the required capital was set equal to two times the monthly renewal expense and Vitality benefit cost. For VitalityHealth, the required capital amount was
    set equal to 1.35 times the Solvency II Pillar 1 Solvency Capital Requirement. For the VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence, the required capital was
    set equal to the UK Solvency I long term insurance capital requirement as per the agreement with Prudential. For the business sold on the Vitality Life
    Limited licence, the required capital was set equal to the excess of 1.4 times the Solvency II Pillar 1 Solvency Capital Requirement.

(1) The mortality and morbidity experience for Life and Invest reflects a period of volatility in mortality claims, as a result of a small number of large claims observed in
    the period.
(2) The premium and fee income experience for Health and Vitality reflects the impact on administration and managed care fees due to the in-period inflation being
    lower than that assumed. For Life, the experience arises largely due to the impact of Vitality status distribution shifts compared to expected levels.
(3) The tax variance for Life and Invest arises due to a movement in the deferred tax asset which delays the payment of tax.
(4) The projection term for Health and Vitality, Life and VitalityHealth at 31 December 2018 has not been changed from that used in the 30 June 2018 embedded value
    calculation. Therefore, an experience variance arises because the total term of the in-force covered business is effectively increased by six months.

The assumed beta is fixed at 0.75. This has been set such that the risk discount rate proxies the result of a Weighted Average Cost of Capital approach with reference to
the capital structure of the Group and the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time period. The observed beta is calculated with reference to the
ALSI. The assumed beta will only change if the capital structure of the Group and/or the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time period suggest
the beta assumption should depart significantly from the assumption at the financial year end. As beta values reflect the historic performance of share prices relative to
the market they may not allow fully for non-market related and non-financial risk. Investors may want to form their own view on an appropriate allowance for these
risks which have not been modelled explicitly.

Life and Invest mortality, morbidity and lapse and surrender assumptions were derived from internal experience, where available, augmented by reinsurance and
industry information.

The Health and Vitality lapse assumptions were derived from the results of recent experience investigations.

The VitalityHealth assumptions were derived from internal experience.

VitalityLife assumptions were derived from internal experience, where available, augmented by reinsurance, industry and Discovery Limited group information.
Renewal expense assumptions were based on the results of the latest expense and budget information.

The initial expenses included in the calculation of the embedded value of new business are the actual costs incurred excluding expenses of an exceptional or
non-recurring nature.

From 30 June 2018, the South African investment return assumptions for Life, Invest, Health and Vitality were based on the publically available Prudential Authority
risk-free nominal yield curve. The real yield assumption was set based on the publically available Prudential Authority risk-free real yield curve, adjusted to remove
volatility due to the nature of the index linked government bond market. Other economic assumptions were set relative to these two yield curves. The 31 December
2017 investment return assumptions, and other related economic assumptions, were based on a single interest rate derived from the risk-free zero coupon
government bond yield curve.

The current and projected tax position of the policyholder funds within the Life company has been taken into account in determining the net investment return
assumption.

The best estimate investment return assumption for VitalityHealth was based on the single interest rate derived from the risk-free zero coupon sterling yield curve.

From 30 June 2018, VitalityHealth calculate the value in-force at the valuation date as the in-force written premium multiplied by the Margin multiplied by the Annuity
Factor, as set out in the table above. The Annuity Factor assumption is derived from assumed future lapse rates and premium increases. The Margin assumption
reflects profit margins after tax and Cost of Capital. The assumptions underlying the Annuity Factor and Margin are set taking into account the current experience in the
business at different durations.

VitalityLife adopts a passive approach for setting economic assumptions. The nominal investment return and real return rate are fixed unless market conditions depart
significantly from the assumptions at the financial year end. Other economic assumptions were set relative to these two passive yields.

The cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the risk discount rate and the net of tax asset return on tangible assets. Vitality Life Limited and
the VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence required capital amount is assumed to earn the same return as the assets backing the VitalityLife policyholder
liabilities. The Life and Invest cost of required capital is calculated assuming shareholder cash flow is limited to the cash flow available after having met both the
required capital amount and an internally defined liquidity target capital requirement of tangible assets.

The embedded value has been calculated in accordance with the Actuarial Society of South Africa's Advisory Practice Note (""APN"") 107: Embedded Value Reporting,
except the recommended disclosure of Free Surplus and Required Capital has been adjusted to take into account the nature of the capital requirements in the covered businesses, 
as can be seen in Table 1 note 2.

Sensitivity to the embedded value assumptions

The risk discount rate uses the CAPM approach with specific reference to the Discovery beta coefficient. As beta values reflect the historic performance of share prices
relative to the market they may not allow fully for non-market related and non-financial risk. Investors may want to form their own view on an appropriate allowance
for these risks which have not been modelled explicitly. The sensitivity of the embedded value and the embedded value of new business at 31 December 2018 to
changes in the risk discount rate is included in the tables below.

For each sensitivity illustrated below, all other assumptions have been left unchanged. No allowance has been made for management action such as risk premium
increases where future experience is worse than the base assumptions.

TRADING UPDATE AND VOLUNTARY TRADING STATEMENT: SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 
 
For its 2019 financial year, Discovery planned to increase investment into new strategic initiatives significantly, most 
notably the build and launch of Discovery Bank, creating an expected reduction in Group earnings (1). This has 
necessitated a more detailed trading update for the six months ended 31 December 2018. 
 
For the six months ended 31 December 2018 (""current period""), Discovery's normalised headline earnings per share 
(undiluted) (2) is expected to decrease by approximately 16% to c366.6 cents (2017: 438.5 cents) compared to the prior 
comparative period (""prior period""). As previously reported, spend on new businesses (3) increased significantly over the 
period and will amount to approximately 21% of Group earnings (including 3% from the associated financing costs). 
New business annualised premium income (""API"") is expected to grow by 16% while the Group's financial leverage ratio 
(""FLR"") is expected to improve to 25% and the central cash buffer to increase to R3.4bn.  
 
The performance for the current period will reflect a manifestation of the planned investment into new businesses and 
a strong operating performance from all of Discovery's businesses, except Discovery Life, which experienced a spike in 
large mortality claims amounting to approximately 8% of Group earnings for the six months. Discovery Life has altered 
its reinsurance structures to ameliorate large-claim volatility going forward.  
 
1) 21% of Group earnings spent on five key new businesses, most notably Discovery Bank 
Discovery significantly increased its investment into new businesses and the income statement impact for the six months 
is c21% of Group earnings. The most notable initiative is Discovery Bank, which was launched in November 2018 for beta 
testing, and is expected to roll-out to the public in March 2019 - the cost incurred in the build, test and run phases of the 
Bank have largely been in line with expectations. Discovery estimates a further R90m to be spent on build until the public 
roll out and a further R180m on test and run. Other important new businesses include Vitality Invest, Vitality1 (the global 
technology platform), Umbrella Funds and Discovery for Business - all with pleasing early receptivity. The spend on new 
businesses is in line with budget and is fully provided for in the Group's capital plan.  
 
2) Operating performance

1 Normalised profit from operations
2 The percentage change in the current period is the same for both undiluted and diluted earnings per share 
3 Excluding JV Card profits   
                                                                                                                    
The following items are worth noting in the table above: 
    a.  Discovery Life experienced a spike in high-value mortality claims, which will reduce its operating profit by 18% and 
        is expected to negatively impact Group earnings by approximately 8%. While the cost of claims was within 
        premium loadings, they exceeded expectation. The skewness is demonstrated by the largest 4.5% of death claims 
        amounting to 38% of the total claims cost. Based on this, and similar volatility in previous periods, Discovery Life 
        has altered its reinsurance structures to ameliorate this volatility going forward. Other aspects of the business 
        performed well - Individual Life new business increased by 14%, and lapses and policy alterations performed in 
        line with expectation. Discovery Life generated strong cash flow, and in addition released R3.5bn of capital due to 
        the implementation of Solvency Assessment Management (""SAM""). Discovery Life is strongly capitalised for future 
        growth. 
    b.  Ping An Health's performance was exceptional, with new business increasing by c117% to R4.3bn (4) over the period, 
        and the business experiencing excellent underlying actuarial dynamics. Significant investment has been made in 
        its operational, technological and system capabilities to facilitate this growth. These investments have dampened 
        operating profit growth before tax to 26%, despite revenue growth of 84%. As the business scales and matures, it 
        is expected that operating margins will increase. The compound revenue growth rate over the past three years 
        has been 68% pa, reflecting the scale of the emerging health insurance market and success of Ping An Health's 
        strategy. The extent of growth and spend on digitalisation and infrastructure has been validated post the reporting 
        period with Ping An Health attracting in excess of one million policies during January 2019.  
    c.  As previously communicated in the SENS announcement of 20 December 2018, SoftBank Vision Fund invested 
        USD500m in Cambridge Mobile Telematics (""CMT""), an associate investment of Discovery and strategic partner 
        to Discovery Insure since 2014. The transaction will reduce Discovery's effective shareholding in CMT to 
        approximately 10% on a fully diluted basis, and generate approximately USD55m (R780m) profit for Discovery.  
        The transaction was completed post the reporting period and will only be reflected in Discovery's full year results. 
 
3) Items impacting normalised headline earnings  
Normalised profit from operations is expected to decrease by approximately 4% to cR3 799m (2017: R3 941m). The 
difference between normalised profit from operations and normalised headline earnings was predominantly affected by 
three aspects. As previously disclosed, an increase in borrowings has resulted in an increase in finance costs of R128m 
over the prior period, mainly due to funding investment in new initiatives. In addition, equity and bond market movements 
resulted in fair value losses of R116m on shareholder investments (which are now reported through profit or loss in terms 
of the newly-adopted IFRS9). Lastly, the accounting treatment of the finance lease relating to Discovery's head office (as 
explained in previous announcements), had a further increased impact of R55m. Headline earnings per share (undiluted (2)) 
is expected to decrease by c18% to c347.4 cents (2017: 426.1 cents) and basic earnings per share (undiluted (2)) by c14% to 
c352.7 cents (2017: 411.7 cents). 
 
4) Prospects for growth 
Discovery's established businesses are well positioned for growth, with Discovery Life expected to revert to target growth 
levels. Similarly, Discovery's emerging businesses are expected to grow strongly going forward. Discovery's new businesses 
will require investment through their start-up phase, however the 21% spend on new businesses is expected to decrease 
over the next few years toward previous levels. Profit growth is expected to return to its stated goal of CPI plus 10% and 
is well capitalised for its five-year planning horizon.  
 
Discovery's results for the six months ended 31 December 2018 are being finalised and are due to be released on SENS on 
21 February 2019. This trading update covers some important elements of the expected results. Whilst Discovery has a 
reasonable degree of certainty that the information contained in this update reflects the outcome for the six months 
ended 31 December 2018, it is subject to final revision and approval. The financial information on which this trading 
statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on by the Company's external auditors.

VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT: CORPORATE ACTION AND UPDATE REGARDING
INVESTMENT IN NEW INITIATIVES

Shareholders are advised of a corporate action which is subject to US regulatory approval and a
number of important initiatives across the Discovery Group that have come to fruition during 2018
which will affect Discovery's financial results for the 6 months to 31 December 2018:

1. The investment by SoftBank Vision Fund in Cambridge Mobile Telematics in which Discovery has
a minority shareholding, and
2. The investments in major new initiatives during the period, notably Discovery Bank and VitalityIn-
vest in the UK.

While the new initiatives have been planned and are largely in line with budget, they will have a
disproportionate impact on the Group's short term results given their scale.

(1) Corporate action involving associate investment in Cambridge Mobile Telematics

Shareholders are advised that Cambridge Mobile Telematics (""CMT""), an associate investment of
Discovery and strategic partner to Discovery Insure since 2014, yesterday announced a US$500 mil-
lion (ZAR7.2 billion) investment from the SoftBank Vision Fund. The transaction is subject to U.S.
regulatory approval.

Upon the completion of the transaction, Discovery's effective shareholding in CMT will reduce to
approximately 10% on a fully diluted basis. Discovery's profit from the transaction will be approxi-
mately US$52 million (ZAR751 million), a portion of which will be realized in cash. Discovery Insure's
strategic partnership with CMT remains in place following the transaction.

This investment will accelerate the adoption of CMT's DriveWell platform, fueling product and market
expansion across insurer and safety solutions.

A full transcript of the CMT announcement is available at CMT's website at:
www.cmtelematics.com

(2) Income statement impact of investment in new initiatives and related finance cost

Shareholders are further advised, that in line with the previously communicated organic growth
methodology of the Group, the investment in new initiatives, including but not limited to Discovery
Bank, VitalityInvest, Discovery Umbrella Fund and Discovery Commercial Insurance, will be signifi-
cantly higher than the previous period and higher than the long term investment guidance of 10%
of trading profit (following a period of investment below this guidance). This is due primarily to the
investment in the launch of Discovery Bank and VitalityInvest, which have been largely in line with
the budgets set for these initiatives and provided for in the Group's medium term capital plan.

It is estimated that the income statement impact of such investments for the six months ending 31
December 2018 will be approximately R620 million compared to the R230 million of the correspond-
ing period of the previous financial year (adjusted for reallocation of card profits to Discovery
Bank). In addition, the period-on-period impact of finance cost resulting from borrowings raised
over the recent reporting periods, mainly to facilitate these new initiatives, will increase from R351
million to approximately R483 million for the six months ending 31 December 2018 (excluding the
continuing impact of the finance lease accounting treatment related to the lease of the new head
office building as explained at year-end).

These initiatives are in line with Discovery's organic growth model which has created substantial
embedded value but will have a short term impact on the Group's reported earnings and related
growth rates in earnings. Discovery expects the spend on new initiatives to, over time, revert to the
investment guidance of within 10% of operating profit.

The figures quoted in this voluntary announcement have not been audited by the Company's
auditors.

PLANNED CHANGES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

In accordance with paragraph 3.59 of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, shareholders are
advised of the following planned changes to the Board of Directors (""Board"") of the
Company.

RETIREMENT OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE BOARD: MR. MONTY HILKOWITZ

Mr. Hilkowitz, independent non-executive Chairperson and Director has informed the Board
of his intention to retire, effective 28 February 2019.

Mr. Hilkowitz has served as a non-executive Director of the Company since April 2002 and
has been Chairperson of the Board since 1 January 2008. During his Chairmanship, Discovery
has grown considerably, launching three new businesses, concluding five joint ventures and
growing its client base from 2.5 million in three markets to 18 million members in 20
markets. Discovery wishes to thank Mr. Hilkowitz for his invaluable contribution to the Group
over the past 16 years.

Mr. Hilkowitz will ensure a controlled handover to the new Chairperson and will continue to
serve as non-executive Director on the Boards of certain of the Group’s UK subsidiaries.

APPOINTMENT OF CHAIRPERSON OF THE BOARD: MR. MARK TUCKER

The Company is pleased to announce the appointment to the Board of Mr. Tucker as
independent non-executive Chairperson and Director, with effect from 1 March 2019.

Mr. Tucker has had a long relationship with Discovery, spanning more than 13 years,
commencing during Discovery’s JV with the Prudential, continuing through its first Vitality
partnership with AIA, and then as a member of Discovery’s International Advisory Board
since 2014. His succession to the Board is seen as critical and timely given that Discovery’s

RESULTS OF THE ACCELERATED BOOKBUILD OFFERING

Shareholders are referred to the announcement released on 8 November 2018 regarding the launch of an accelerated
bookbuild offering by way of a vendor consideration placement (the ""Placement""). Discovery is pleased to announce that it
has successfully closed and priced the Placement.

The Placement will result in the issue of 11,445,744 new Discovery ordinary shares (the ""Placement Shares"") to qualifying
investors at a price of ZAR162.00 per ordinary share for a total consideration of ZAR1.85 billion. The sale price represents a
2.0% premium to Discovery’s 30 day VWAP of ZAR158.84 as at the close of trade on 8 November 2018.

As part of the Placement, certain directors of Discovery including, A Gore, B Swartzberg and H Mayers, collectively subscribed
for 1,482,261 Placement Shares (the ""Participating Directors’ Shares"") at the clearing price of the bookbuild. The issue and
settlement of the Participating Directors’ Shares remains subject to the approval of the necessary resolutions at the annual
general meeting of Discovery shareholders, scheduled for 26 November 2018, authorising the issue of the Participating
Directors’ Shares in terms of section 41(1) of the Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008, as amended.

An application will be made to the JSE for the listing of the Placement Shares, excluding the Participating Directors’ Shares.
Subject to approval by the JSE, listing and trading of the Placement Shares, excluding the Participating Directors’ Shares, is
expected to commence at 09h00 on Wednesday, 14 November 2018.

Discovery has agreed, pursuant to a placing agreement entered into with the Joint Bookrunners (as named below), not to
issue or sell any further Discovery ordinary shares for a period of 90 days after the closing of the Placement, subject to
customary exceptions and waiver by the Joint Bookrunners.

ACCELERATED BOOKBUILD OFFERING OF NEW DISCOVERY ORDINARY SHARES TO RAISE UP TO ZAR1.85
BILLION

Discovery shareholders (""Shareholders"") are referred to Discovery’s audited results for the year ended 30 June 2018, which
were published on 4 September 2018, wherein they were advised that Discovery and FirstRand Investment Holdings Limited
(""FRIHL"") had reached an agreement in terms of which Discovery will:
    – acquire FRIHL’s effective 25.01% interest in Discovery Bank Limited (""Discovery Bank"");
    – acquire the remaining 25.01% economic interest that FirstRand Bank Limited (together with FRIHL the ""FirstRand
      Group"") currently owns in the Discovery card joint venture business; and
    – through Discovery Bank, acquire all rights to the Discovery card book and related assets which will be migrated to
      Discovery over time (collectively ""the Acquisition"").

The total combined acquisition price payable by Discovery to the FirstRand Group will be ZAR1.85 billion (""Acquisition
Consideration""). Since the Acquisition constitutes a new initiative and presents an important opportunity for Discovery, the
board has decided that the Acquisition should be funded by way of an equity issuance limited to the Acquisition Consideration.

Shareholders are now advised that all regulatory approvals for the Acquisition have been obtained.

The Vendor Consideration Placing

Investors are advised of the launch of a placing of new Discovery ordinary shares (the ""Placement Shares"") to raise up to
ZAR1.85 billion, by way of a vendor consideration placement as contemplated in the JSE Listings Requirements (the
""Placement""), the proceeds of which will be used to settle the Acquisition Consideration. The Placement is being made to
qualifying investors (as set out in the disclaimer below) only and is not an offer to the public in any jurisdiction.

Rand Merchant Insurance Holdings Limited (""RMI"") currently holds 25% of Discovery’s ordinary shares and have indicated
that they intend to apply for up to ZAR464 million worth of Placement Shares at the clearing price of the bookbuild.

Certain directors of Discovery including, A Gore, B Swartzberg and H Mayers (the ""Participating Directors""), collectively
holding 13% of Discovery’s ordinary shares, have irrevocably committed to subscribe for in aggregate ZAR240 million worth
of Placement Shares at the clearing price of the bookbuild. The subscription by the Participating Directors remains subject to
the approval of the necessary resolutions at the annual general meeting of Discovery shareholders, scheduled for 26
November 2018, authorising the issue of Placement Shares to the Participating Directors in terms of section 41(1) of the
Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008, as amended.

The book for the Placement is open with immediate effect and is expected to close as soon as possible. Pricing and allocations
will be announced as soon as practicable following the closing of the book.

Rand Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc are acting as joint
bookrunners for the Placement (the ""Joint Bookrunners""). Discovery has agreed, pursuant to a placing agreement entered
into with the Joint Bookrunners, not to issue or sell any further Discovery ordinary shares for a period of 90 days after the
closing of the Placement, subject to customary exceptions and waiver by the Joint Bookrunners.

Discovery delivers on 2018 Ambition as the Group evolves into a powerful global platform

Commentary

The 2018 Ambition and its frameworks delivered a strong financial performance across the Group

Discovery's core purpose of making people healthier and enhancing and protecting their lives has manifested in a globally relevant model of Shared-Value Insurance.
The Group's confidence in the efficacy and impact of this model resulted in the setting of the 2018 Ambition four years ago, core to which are Discovery's growth
engine, capital philosophy and cash framework. These have proved to be robust mechanisms for managing the Group's growth and investment, as demonstrated over
the period. In addition, the 2018 Ambition has served as a powerful strategic framework to guide the mandate and priorities of Discovery's businesses, which all
performed excellently over the financial year, and are well positioned for continued growth. The financial results must be viewed in this light.

Discovery delivered a strong financial performance for the 12 months ended 30 June 2018. Normalised operating profit increased by 17% to R8 266 million; normalised
headline earnings increased by 16% to R5 401 million (20% increase to R5 609 million excluding the impact of finance lease accounting in respect of 1 Discovery Place);
core new business Annualised Premium Income (which excludes Discovery Health's take-on of new closed medical schemes and gross revenue of Vitality Group)
increased by 10% to R16 137 million; and normalised headline earnings per share increased 16% to 836.9c (diluted). The Embedded Value grew by 15% on an
annualised basis to R65.6 billion, and return on equity exceeded risk-free + 9%, despite considerable investment in new businesses.

The Group generated R10.6 billion in cash from in-force businesses, and after payment of tax, dividends and interest on debt, invested R7.8 billion in new business and
R2 billion in new initiatives, with favourable returns - the Group new business internal rate of return was 26%, growth in value of new business was 16%, and
investments met the criteria of risk-free + 10%, validating the approach to continue to invest significantly without breaching the capital plan.

Discovery maintained a within-guidance cash buffer of R1.7 billion as at 30 June 2018 and the Financial Leverage Ratio reduced to 25.8% at the end of the financial year,
remaining below the limit of 28%.

The diversified portfolio of businesses performed excellently with strong growth potential

Every business grew operating profit at least in line with expectation, and with the exception of VitalityLife, all established businesses generated cash, positive
experience variances, and returns on capital at or near the Group target.

The established businesses achieved combined growth in operating profit of 14% to R8 661 million (CPI + 9%) - above the targeted CPI + 5%. All are of scale and
continue to grow, with Discovery Health leading in open scheme market share, Discovery Life leading in new business market share, Discovery Invest in the top three
takers of net flows in the retail space, and VitalityHealth and VitalityLife in the top five market leaders. In addition, these businesses entered adjacencies over the
period, including the launch of Discovery for Business in South Africa; and the long-term savings business, VitalityInvest, in the UK - further building out the UK
composite model.

The emerging businesses of Discovery Insure, Vitality Group, and Ping An Health grew operating profit by 193% to R158 million, exceeding their target of CPI + 30%.
These businesses all turned profitable over the period and have significant latent potential. Discovery Insure is the fastest-growing short-term insurer in the country;
Vitality Group is building a global franchise with leading partners; and Ping An Health is the top specialist health insurer in China. All three businesses continued to scale
and innovate while maintaining positive actuarial dynamics, adding value to the Group.

In addition, over the period 7% of earnings was invested in new initiatives including Umbrella Funds, VitalityInvest, Discovery Insure Commercial Insurance and
Discovery Bank.

Individual business performance

Discovery Health

Discovery Health delivered excellent results for the period. Operating profit increased by 11% to R2 777 million; new business API increased by 8% to R6 573 million
(excluding take-on of new closed schemes); and lives under management reached 3.5 million. Discovery Health continued to grow its restricted medical scheme client
base, to 18 client schemes, with over 667 000 lives under management. The business was awarded the tender for the Engen Medical Benefit Fund, which came onto the
Discovery Health platform on 1 July 2018. The Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) continued to create value for members, with average contributions 16.4%
lower than the eight nearest open scheme competitors on a plan-for-plan basis. DHMS membership increased by 2% to 2.8 million lives, with an annualised lapse rate
of 4.8%. Discovery Health's mandate remains clear - to provide its members with access to high quality, affordable healthcare on a sustainable basis, while assisting in
enhancing the healthcare system for all South Africans. In this regard, there were three major themes over the period under review: Discovery Health's response to
regulatory developments; its efforts to curb the impact of steep medical inflation by providing better value for money and deflationary administration fees; and the
development of a richer, more integrated value offering for employers.

Discovery Health continues to engage actively with all regulators in relation to key developments including the Health Market Inquiry, the National Health Insurance Bill,
and the Medical Schemes Amendment Bill. Most of the findings and recommendations in the provisional report of the Health Market Inquiry released in June 2018 are
sound and consistent with Discovery Health's views, and will have a positive impact on the private healthcare system if implemented as proposed. Discovery Health also
maintains its strong support for the proposed National Health Insurance system, and continues to work closely with the National Department of Health and other
stakeholders to ensure optimal outcomes.

High medical inflation remains endemic, driven by a combination of supply and demand factors, as well as the recent increase in VAT. Supply-side factors include
growth in new hospital facilities and new high-cost medicines and devices. Key demand-side factors include ongoing adverse selection trends and the increasing burden
of chronic diseases and cancer, as well as the gradual ageing of the Scheme's membership base.

To manage these trends, Discovery Health continued to invest substantially in risk management assets and systems; healthcare quality improvement programmes; an
integrated digital technology platform; as well as data science and artificial intelligence capabilities and systems. Over the past year, approximately R140 million was
invested in these and related initiatives, delivering significant improvements in operational efficiencies and enhancing Discovery Health's globally leading Shared-Value
health insurance model. This model benefits all of Discovery Health's 19 medical scheme clients as well as their more than 3.5 million members, by securing the lowest
cost of care available in the South African market, material improvements in the quality of healthcare services, and best-in-class client services.

Fraud control was another major focus, with recoveries for 2018 projected to be in excess of R500 million. In the case of DHMS, Discovery Health achieved risk
management savings of approximately R5.7 billion during 2017, representing 11.9% of potential risk claims, and return on investment on the Scheme's managed care
fees of 269%.

In May 2018, Discovery Health launched Discovery for Business along with other Discovery business units. This is an integrated corporate offering including
PrimaryCare, Discovery HealthyCompany (a digitally driven, science-based Employee Assistance Programme), as well as Umbrella Fund and Group Risk products. This
new offering provides a complete health and wellness solution for businesses, contributing to increases in business productivity and wellbeing. The response has been
extremely positive thus far, with strong growth and pipelines for all products.

Discovery Life

Discovery Life delivered a robust performance with a focus on quality, prudence and enhancing the Shared-Value Insurance model. The business grew earnings
by 7% to R3 837 million, benefiting from a strong second half, while new business Annualised Premium Income increased by 1% to R2 188 million. New business
market share increased to 31%(1) in the retail affluent protection segment, while the value of new business (individual) grew by 8%. Individual Life new business grew
4% in tough market conditions and Group Risk new business was down 29% off a high base, due to a single large scheme being acquired in the second half of the 2017
financial year.

Discovery Life continued to enhance the impact of the Shared-Value model, with considerable product innovation over the period. This led to growth in market share
and VNB margin, with engaged Vitality members continuing to exhibit lower mortality experience. The Global Education Protector was recognised as one of the most
innovative life insurance products globally(2); while the new Purple Life plan led to a 23% increase in policies with cover over R10 million. The clinical refinement of the
Vitality points structure, which accelerated over the period, resulted in positive behaviour change as clients strove to maintain their integration benefits (PayBacks of
R973 million were paid to Discovery Life policyholders).

Another theme was the considerable focus on assumptions and financial and actuarial management. Discovery Life differs from its competitors in that it is less than
two decades old and has grown in-force premium at 25% per annum organically from June 2002 to June 2018; transacts predominantly long-term Whole of Life
business; and uses the Shared-Value Insurance model to dynamically adjust premiums and benefits based on Vitality engagement. While this results in additional
complexity in predicting policyholder behaviour and its impact on profit emergence, the efficacy of the actuarial control framework was demonstrated over the period.
Although management interventions resulted in a positive policy alterations variance for the second half of the financial year, further prudence was introduced by a
strengthening of assumptions. The economic assumptions were updated to better align with the observed shapes of the yield curves. Additional prudence was
introduced in the Embedded Value by limiting the term of valuing shareholder cash flows to 40 years.

Claims experience recovered in the second half of the year, at 91% of expected compared to 108.3% at December 2017. The claims experience in the first half was
impacted by a number of large, non-natural deaths. Policy lapses were 82% of expectation, emphasising the efficacy of the model.

Discovery Life remains well-capitalised at 3.5x CAR cover and generated cash after tax of R3 519 million (including Discovery Invest) from the in-force book over the
period (before reinsurance and acquisition-related costs). It invested the majority of this in profitable new business growth, ending in a net cash generation of R539
million. The implementation of SAM in 2018/19 is expected to result in a significant release of capital from Discovery Life, resulting in lower assets being held and lower
associated investment income, although improving the business's return on capital.

Discovery Invest

Discovery Invest's performance was robust amid weak financial markets. Operating profit grew 19% to R885 million, driven by an 18% increase in assets under
administration to R81.8 billion, with 77% of linked funds in Discovery funds. Net flows grew by 10% to R6.4 billion. Discovery Invest also saw a significant improvement
in new business in the second half of the year, smoothing out the first half to end flat for the full-year (excluding the effect of the R500 million corporate endowment
sold in June 2017). The focus over the period was refining the use of the Shared-Value model in the context of long-term savings.

The Discovery Life Collective Investment Scheme remained in the top 10 retail flow takers while the Discovery Balanced Fund continued to perform well, placing in the
first performance quartile over one, three, five and 10 years. In the PlexCrown Ratings, a widely-quoted unit trust rating agency in South Africa, Discovery Invest
remained in the top five fund managers.

The business saw continued evidence of positive behaviour change as a result of the Shared-Value model. Discovery Invest's Boosts led to demonstrable results in
terms of members saving for longer, in greater quantities, getting healthier, and withdrawing less. This manifested in superior long-term retirement outcomes for
clients, as well as sustainable profitability for the business. Discovery Invest also advanced its digital programme, launching an intuitive digital hub for advisers'
investment servicing and more interactive investment statements for clients.

In May 2018, Discovery extended its Shared-Value model by launching an Umbrella Fund together with a revised Group Risk Payback product, under the banner of a
new Discovery Employee Benefits solution.

Discovery Insure

Discovery Insure had a strong period, turning to profitability to deliver a full-year profit of R68 million. Gross Premium Income grew 28% to R2.7 billion and new
business increased by 17% to R1.05 billion. The business focused on executing its business model in the personal lines market, with proven results in selection,
behaviour change, and selective lapsation, evidenced by the high quality of the in-force book. This bodes well for future growth in profitability as the quality of the
in-force book improves with policy duration. Based on this experience, Discovery Insure launched a powerful interpretation of its shared-value model for the SME
market.

Discovery Insure's strong performance over the period was driven by the continued success of the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model, which incentivises and
rewards good driving behaviour. Loss ratios are highly correlated to engagement resulting in an improving book over time, with a 7.1% absolute reduction in loss ratio
over the past 24 months. Data analytics played a role in improving efficiencies in pricing, fraud detection and network management. This resulted in the existing
Discovery Insure book (excluding the impact of new business) producing R235 million in profit over the full financial year.

Based on the proven efficacy of the model, Discovery Insure entered the commercial insurance market over the period. The commercial offering deals with traditional
physical risks as well as modern risks such as reputational and cyber, and uses technology to enhance risk assessment techniques. The fleet product rewards drivers
and fleet owners, while a partnership with leading global business accelerator, Endeavor, offers clients a diagnostic to identify risks, as well as a curated market place
with business development partners.

In terms of global strategy, Discovery Insure continues to explore the opportunity to extend the model into international markets as an extension of the Global Vitality
Network.

Vitality UK businesses

Discovery's UK business produced excellent results during the period, with combined new business increasing by 12% to R2.28 billion (£132 million); operating profit
growing by 44% to R1.1 billion (£64 million); and total lives growing by 11% to 1.1 million. The composite business is attaining scale in the UK, with both the launch of
VitalityInvest and the exceptional performance over the period creating considerable opportunity for continued growth. The value of in-force for the UK business
increased by 25% to R12.5 billion over the period.

VitalityInvest brings together behavioural economics, savings and wellness to incentivise people to save sooner, invest for longer, manage their income drawdown and
look after their health. Successful delivery relies on bespoke financial planning and cash flow modelling tools built on Vitality's proprietary research and data on life
expectancy. This has been developed in collaboration with partners such as the University of Cambridge and RAND Europe.

Vitality continued to see positive member engagement, with 46% growth in points-earning activities (includes screenings, nutrition and physical activity) to 36 million,
and high levels of benefit utilisation, from Starbucks to cinema tickets. Vitality also made ongoing investments in its brand, adding Disney in a partnership aimed at
children; signing on two new ambassadors; and extending its presence and sponsorship in cricket, football and hockey.

VitalityHealth

VitalityHealth delivered outstanding results. New business increased by 14% to R1.1 billion (£64 million), with the Individual segment up 13%, making up half of total
sales. Operating profit increased by 108% to R589 million (£34 million), reflecting continued strong performance across all business metrics, including improved risk
profile of new business, increased member engagement, sophisticated care pathways, enhanced robustness in claims management, and benefits from the Health
Purchasing Alliance (HPA) arrangement.

The strong Vitality chassis and aspirational brand, combined with the effects of various interventions over the past few years (such as claims management) resulted in
better selection, exceptional Vitality engagement and strong positive selective lapsation. The enhanced claims management initiatives resulted in excellent performance
for the period. During the financial year the VitalityHealth back book generated excess cash of R1.6 billion. After new business acquisition costs and investment in
developing the business, R475 million of cash surplus was generated.

VitalityLife

This was an important period for VitalityLife, as it continued its focus on being fit for purpose in the low interest rate environment. New business increased by 10% to
R1.17 billion (£67.7 million), with particularly strong sales in the second half of the year. VitalityLife's operating profit increased by 6% to R515 million (£29.7 million). The
business completely reengineered itself for a low interest rate environment, with all new business repriced and the business mix changed towards more term
assurance and indexed business. The profit result also reflects a shift toward a passive investment rate assumption.

VitalityLife continued to innovate within the UK protection market. Following the success of the Optimiser products launched in 2016, VitalityLife introduced a new
version of the product aimed at smaller policies. The combined impact resulted in over 70% of all new business being optimised. At the same time, VitalityLife
continued to strongly promote the benefit of indexation of premiums in protecting customers from the financially eroding effect of inflation. The new business margin
increased from 36% to 39% year-on-year.

Product development was supported by growth in the distribution footprint across all channels, which has positioned VitalityLife for continued sales growth in future.
Strong sales for the year resulted in the business surpassing the milestone of half a million lives insured during 2018.

The fundamentals of the VitalityLife business remained strong, with positive claims variances over the year and improving lapse experience seen over the second half
of the financial year. The VitalityLife investment rate assumption was reviewed and set in line with the long-term risk-adjusted yield expected from a basket of fixed
interest securities. The move to a long-term view of the investment assumption improves the reliability and stability of IFRS results.

Vitality Group

Vitality Group delivered excellent results for the period under review, transitioning to profitability with a profit of $2.6 million (R34 million), compared to an $8.5 million
(R116 million) loss in 2017. Fee income reached $50 million (R645 million) and new business integrated insurance premiums grew 78% to $390 million (R5 billion).
Insurance partners' membership increased by 91% to over 750 000 and total Vitality Group membership reached 1.56 million*. All business segments are now profitable,
achieved through strong growth and operational efficiencies, as well as continued investment in the Global Vitality Platform and its ability to serve partners and
customers. Vitality Group is well positioned for growth, with a codified model for extracting maximum value per market, which includes the following broad strategies:
1) Exploiting latent potential by partnering with the leading insurers in the largest insurance markets; 2) partnering with Hannover Re to rapidly roll out repeatable
Vitality offerings in smaller markets; and 3) expanding Vitality to adjacencies beyond insurance or traditional distribution channels. Importantly, the Vitality One technology
infrastructure went live over the period, offering a globally unified systems architecture that all markets can access.

* Membership represents full Vitality members only.

A significant development over the period was the launch of Vitality Shared-Value Insurance with Sumitomo Life in Japan. The launch took place in Tokyo on 17 July
2018, with excellent reception and media coverage, and Sumitomo Life has gone live on the Vitality One platform.

In addition to this, the partnership with Hannover Re will see three new markets signed on in the next 12 months.

Vitality USA

Vitality USA serves the employees of its corporate clients in the United States, and saw high and sustained engagement among users. Vitality USA is making significant
progress in extending its offering to clients beyond employers with its Apple Watch and Active Rewards programmes. Vitality USA has also extended its platform
through its Gateway offering by providing access to a curated list of health applications and services. This offering has broad application to all businesses interested in
the value generated from behavioural change.

AIA Vitality

AIA Vitality, the most mature Vitality Group insurance partnership, continued its exceptional performance across all launched territories. Over the period, new business
Annualised Net Premium grew by 85% and Vitality membership grew by 110%. Vitality continues to gain traction in existing markets - as at 30 June 2018, Vitality was
integrated with over 60 AIA products and was live in 10 AIA markets.

John Hancock and Manulife Vitality

Both John Hancock Vitality and Manulife Vitality demonstrated strong sales growth, increased engagement and an uptick in net promoter scores over the period. The
increase in sales was achieved through the launch of new Vitality integrated products, increasing broker and consumer adoption, and the strong performance of the
direct-to-consumer channel in the United States.

Generali Vitality

Generali Vitality operates in three markets, Germany, France and Austria, of which Germany and France are Generali's second and third largest markets by premium
volume respectively. Progress was made over the year to expand the distribution channels and develop the products in the markets. In the second half of the financial
year, Vitality membership numbers grew by 40%, reflecting the successful launch of Generali Vitality in Austria and Germany's biggest distribution force's (DVAG's)
introduction to Generali Vitality-linked insurance products.

Ping An Health

Ping An Health had an exceptional year with new business growing by 87% to RMB 2.9 billion and revenue growing by 80% to RMB 4.9 billion. Discovery's share of Ping
An Health's profit, net of Discovery costs, increased by 279% to $4.4 million. The business fundamentals remained strong, with lapses meeting expectation and the
overall loss ratio performing better than expectation. Ping An Health's growth and strategy is being driven by five important factors: China's health insurance market is
expected to continue growing significantly; there is potential to extract more value from distribution by using technology; product strategies are being adapted to
market realities; investments are being made into scaling operations; and Discovery is increasing the sophistication of risk management to ensure sustainability.

The business mix moved significantly towards individual retail products over the last two years, with Ping An Health's internet product showing exceptional growth and
performance. The Group high-end and individual mid-end products continued to make good progress, and the growth remains within the existing capital and business
plan.

Ping An Health's current performance implies that capital required to sustain business growth over the next three years is unlikely to exceed R500 million. Ping An
Health is adequately capitalised from a solvency perspective, but additional capital is required to maintain an A credit rating by AM Best to retain its reinsurance licence
(Ping An Health acquired a reinsurance licence to attain national distribution for its products. Ping An Life agents now sell Ping An Health products in regions where
Ping An Health does not have an insurance licence, and Ping An Health gets access to the underwriting profits through a reinsurance agreement with Ping An Life). 
It should be noted that Ping An Health profit for FY2019 will be impacted by a higher effective tax rate. 

The market for private healthcare in China has continued to grow on the back of macroeconomic factors that strengthen demand: more than 100 million people are
expected to join the Chinese middle class in the next decade; and more than $100 billion in annual healthcare costs are still out-of-pocket. In addition, China leads the
world in fintech adoption, which has led to the accelerated rise of premiums from health insurance products distributed through the internet.

Ping An Health's strategic imperative is to utilise technology to become China's largest health insurer. There has been considerable focus on expanding operations and
investing in technology to sustain its fast growth. The objective is to continue growing the client base, while giving clients the best experience and increasing efficiencies.
Ping An Health is also working on initiatives to develop additional distribution channels and expand into new cities and provinces.

The Ping An Health App was launched in 2016 for the distribution of health insurance products and member servicing, and has since attracted over 8.5 million users.
Premium revenue sold directly on the app exceeded RMB 100 million in the second half of the 2018 financial year. It was the first internet insurance app to reach
breakeven within two years of its launch and is widely recognised by the industry.

In August 2018, Ping An Health launched the I-Kang Bao elderly medical product on the Ping An Health App, giving protection for cancer and accidental in-patient
reimbursement. This product aims to get younger people to download the App and buy products for their parents, as the target age range is 45+. A similar product,
targeting ages 0-70, was also launched for sale through all other channels including Ping An Life agents, and together these products have achieved a run rate of more
than 1.5 million RMB in sales per day since launch.

The business also saw continued engagement in Run Vitality with Ping An Life, which reached over four million members on Vitality, with an engagement rate of 68%.

A considerable focus was placed on the build and shareholding of Discovery Bank

Shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement on 16 October 2017 wherein they were advised that Discovery had been granted a banking licence by the
Registrar of Banks (now the Chief Executive Officer of the Prudential Authority, SARB). At the time we also advised that the approval from the Registrar contained
certain conditions relating to the shareholding of Discovery Bank, the impacts of which were being considered by all affected parties.

A condition relating to the shareholding of Discovery Bank imposed by the Registrar, is that the proposed 25.01% ultimate crossholding in Discovery Bank by FirstRand
Investment Holdings Limited (""FRIHL"") should be reduced and ultimately exited over a period of time.

Given this condition, Discovery and FRIHL have since agreed that it would be preferable for FRIHL to exit entirely as soon as practically possible.

The proposed transaction therefore includes:

- the acquisition of the effective 25.01% interest of FRIHL in Discovery Bank
- acquiring the remaining 25.01% economic interest that FirstRand currently owns in the Discovery Card joint venture business
- Discovery Bank acquiring all rights to the Discovery card book and related assets which will be migrated over time

The transaction is subject to approval by certain regulatory authorities including the Prudential Authority and the Competition Authorities.

The total combined acquisition price payable by Discovery to the FirstRand Group will be R1.8 billion. Discovery has provided guidance that it plans to pursue existing
growth initiatives without recourse to additional capital. As demonstrated in its performance during the period under review, the Group and its growth initiatives have
delivered strongly, and the capital plan has evolved stronger than expected. This gives Discovery the opportunity of continued growth accompanied by a stronger balance
sheet with less leverage and larger cash buffers. Since the acquisition of the remaining 25% constitutes a new initiative and presents an important opportunity for the
Group, the Board decided that this acquisition should be funded by way of an equity issuance limited to the purchase price. Given the relative immateriality, the
transaction does not require shareholder approval.

Although these developments have delayed the process slightly, the Bank build is progressing well and remains within budget, and the launch is expected before the
end of 2018.

In relation to this, Discovery Card's performance was excellent, and bodes well for the Bank. In the group's segmental reports, the Discovery Card joint venture profits
and additional 54.99% profit share (received by way of after tax dividends) have been reallocated to Discovery Bank and disclosed in ""All other segments"" and
comparatives were restated where appropriate. Profits for the Discovery Card JV with FNB grew by 17% to R414 million and revenue increased by 6% to R1 billion. In
addition, Discovery's credit card base is less sensitive to negative market conditions due to a substantially better risk profile. Both its percentage of non-performing
loans and cost to income ratio were significantly below the average of other South African banks.

Prospects for growth

Discovery is well positioned for growth. Setting apart the effect of the Bank, Discovery expects continued growth without recourse to additional capital. The investment
in Bank will impact earnings for the 2019 year, as post launch the amortisation of the build cost will emerge. Thereafter, the organic growth model is expected to revert to its long-term average.

Refer to 'Significant transactions affecting the current results' for details on the accounting treatment of Discovery's new head office.

Normalised operating profit per the segmental information, reflects the cash rental costs separately from the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) finance
lease treatment, as individual business expenses and margins are managed on underlying cash rental costs incurred by each business.

Normalised headline earnings adjusted for the impact of the accounting treatment of the new head office lease, would result in an increase of R208 million in
normalised headline earnings to R5 609 million (increase of 20% compared to the prior financial year). The adjustment is calculated by replacing the depreciation of
R126 million and finance charges of R210 million recognised in line with IFRS, with the actual market related rentals of R128 million.

Normalised headline earnings per share (with market related cash rentals)(cents) would be 869.5 on an undiluted basis and 869.0 on a diluted basis.

Fair value hierarchy of financial instruments

The Group's financial instruments measured at fair value have been disclosed using a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy has three levels that reflect the significance of
the inputs used in measuring fair value. These are as follows:

Level 1 includes financial instruments that are measured using unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for identical financial instruments. Quoted prices are
readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly
occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.

Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data. Instruments in this category are valued using:

(a) quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which are not considered to be active or
(b) valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.

Level 3 includes financial instruments that are valued using valuation techniques that incorporate information other than observable market data and where at least
one input (which could have a significant effect on instruments' valuation) cannot be based on observable market data.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments in level 2

- Discovery has invested in equity linked notes offered by international banks in order to back certain unit-linked contract liabilities. The calculation of the daily value of
  the equity linked investments is made by the provider of the note. Discovery has procedures in place to ensure that these prices are correct. Aside from the daily
  reasonableness checks versus similar funds and movement since the prior day's price, the fund values are calculated with reference to a specific formula or index,
  disclosed to the policyholders, which is recalculated by Discovery in order to check if the price provided by the provider is correct.

- If a quoted market price is not available on a recognised stock exchange or from a broker for non-exchange traded financial instruments, the fair value of the
  instrument is estimated by the asset managers, using valuation techniques including the use of recent arm's length market transactions, reference to the current fair
  value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow techniques, option pricing models or other valuation techniques that provide a
  reliable estimate of prices obtained in actual market transactions.

- The fair value of the hedged derivatives is calculated as follows:
  (a) The fair value of call options is calculated on a Black-Scholes model.
  (b) The fair value of the return swaps is calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the instruments.
  (c) The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.

New business annualised premium income

(1) The new business API for Closed Schemes includes additional lives on existing closed schemes. The new business API for New Closed
    Schemes includes contracted new business API and business in the first twelve months of on-boarding. Closed Schemes refer to those
    restricted to certain employers and industries.
(2) Previously Ping An Health included 100% of the new business API. This has been restated to only include 25% in line with the Group's
    effective shareholding of 25% of this associate.
(3) Vitality Group new business includes gross recurring and lump sum revenues earned by Vitality Group and specifically excludes
    revenue related to cost recoveries and rewards.

Calculation of new business API

New business API is calculated at 12 times the monthly premium for new recurring premium policies and 10% of the value of new single premium policies. It also
includes both automatic premium increases and servicing increases on existing long-term insurance policies. The amounts exclude indirect taxes.

The new business API in the table above differs from the new business API disclosed in the embedded value largely as a result of:

- Inclusion of automatic premium increases and servicing increases on existing life policies - These are included in the table above but excluded in the embedded value
  API values disclosed.

- The timing of inclusion of policyholders in the calculation of new business API - In the embedded value, new business is included from the earlier of the date that
  the first premium has been received or when the policy is on risk, whereas in the table above, new business is included when the policy has been contractually
  committed.

Refer to the footnotes to Table 7: Embedded Value of New Business for a more detailed description of the differences in new business disclosures between the
embedded value and the table above.

(1) The comparatives have been restated to reallocate the DiscoveryCard joint arrangement and the additional 54.99% DiscoveryCard
    profit share from established businesses to the 'Development and other segments'. This restatement was necessary as management
    control over the credit card operations in the Group has moved from Discovery Vitality to Discovery Bank and disclosed accordingly in
    the segmental report. The Discovery Card joint arrangement and 54.99% DiscoveryCard profit share amounts to R259 million (2017:
    R165 million). The latter in the form of after tax dividends.

Emerging businesses are those businesses that have achieved sufficient scale to be profitable or profitable in the near future, although not yet significant in cash
generation for the Group and likely to require funds to support new business growth. These businesses are approximately 5 years into their launch. Discovery Insure,
which has been disclosed in 'Emerging businesses', excludes the commercial offering which is a new venture that commenced during the year under review and is
shown in 'Development and other segments'.

'Development and other segments' include costs of start-up businesses and expenses incurred to investigate new products and markets. Start-up costs include costs in
relation to the Discovery Bank, Vitality Invest which is the recently launched UK investment business, a commercial offering in Discovery Insure, and an Umbrella Fund
offering in Discovery Invest. Unallocated head office costs are also included in this segment.

Significant transactions affecting the current results

Discovery's new head office

Discovery has entered into a 15 year lease agreement for its new head office which comprises two phases of development. The lease commenced November 2017 and
March 2018 for Phase I and Phase II respectively. Discovery started taking occupancy of the buildings at those dates, on a phased approach.

IAS 17: Leases, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all
the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

In terms of the indicators provided in IAS 17.10 and IAS 17.11, Discovery has classified the lease as a finance lease given that the present value of the minimum lease
payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset. This accounting treatment has resulted in the recognition of an asset of R3 155
million, which has been disclosed in 'Property and equipment' and a corresponding lease liability, which has been disclosed in 'Borrowings' in the Statement of financial
position. It should be noted that ownership of the building does not transfer at the end of the lease period but remains that of the landlord.

The treatment under IFRS 16: Leases, effective for reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019, would result in a similar treatment with the lease
capitalised and as a result the accounting treatment in respect of this particular lease is aligned with the future accounting standard effective not yet adopted by
Discovery.

The recognised asset is depreciated over the lease term, using the straight-line method. R126 million depreciation has been recognised in profit or loss for the
respective periods since beneficial occupancy. Finance charges of R210 million have been recognised in profit or loss in respect of the finance lease liability. Normalised
profit from operations includes the market related rental paid.

As Discovery took occupancy of the new building on a phased approach various building costs, such as rental, have been duplicated during the transitional period in
the current financial year as costs were incurred on both the new and old premises. For the calculation of normalised headline earnings, duplicate rental charges of R37
million have been added back.

      which GBP 13 million was a voluntary prepayment. The balance owing at 30 June 2018 amounts to GBP 99.7 million (R1 810 million)
      (2017: GBP 127.5 million (R2 174 million)).

      Interest rates on these facilities are floating, linked to 3 month LIBOR, payable quarterly in arrears. Finance charges of R40 million

      Moody's assigned a Aa3.za issuer rating to Discovery Limited on 20 October 2017.

      a.    During the current financial year, Discovery registered an unsecured R10 billion Domestic Medium Term Note (DMTN)
            programme. In terms of this programme, Discovery issued R1.5 billion JSE Listed Notes in its inaugural issuance on 21 November

      b.    Discovery Central Services, a subsidiary of the Discovery Group, concluded a 10 year loan facility agreement of R650 million in
            December 2016, of which R495 million was utilised in the previous financial year. The remaining portion of this facility of R155
            million was utilised during this financial period and R73 million was repaid in terms of the agreement. Interest rates on the facility
            are fixed at a weighted average rate of 11.56% per annum, with capital and interest repayable in instalments over the duration of
            the loan facility.

      c.    Discovery Limited entered into a new unsecured R1 billion 5 year loan facility agreement in March 2018, which was fully drawn
            down in June 2018. Interest rates on this facility is linked to 3 month JIBAR, plus 245 bps. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears
            and capital is repayable in full at maturity on 2 March 2023. Interest rates on this facility have been fixed at 10.275% per annum,
            through an interest rate swap.

Finance charges of R512 million (2017: R368 million) in respect of these South African borrowings have been recognised in profit or loss.

Negative reserve funding (acquisition cost funding)

This liability represents the acquisition costs in respect of business written on the Prudential Assurance Company's (Prudential) life insurance license and were funded
by Prudential. The liability is repaid on a matched basis as the cash flows emerge from this business. In the event that the cash flows do not emerge as anticipated,
VitalityLife would be required to repay these liabilities from other resources.

In terms of the level premium reinsurance treaty entered into in respect of this business, a security deposit was required to be placed by the reinsurer, to reduce
counterparty risk. At 30 June 2018, GBP 169 million (R3 065 million) (2017: GBP 147 million (R2 501 million)) was held as a security deposit. The contractual arrangement
in respect of the business written on the Prudential license is accounted for as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4 and as a result, the 'deposit back' held has been
disclosed as a reduction of the negative reserve funding liability.

During the 2018 financial year, additional amounts were received as 'deposit back' in excess of the negative reserve funding. The agreements indicate that offset is
applicable up to the amount of the negative reserve funding. Any additional amounts of the deposit back received thereafter, are included in cash. The corresponding
liability to the reinsurer has been accounted for in Trade and other payables.

The decrease in the negative reserve funding liability in the current financial year, relates to the partial repayment of funding by VitalityLife as well as an increase in the
amount of deposit back held, which has been offset against the liability. There is still an amount payable to Prudential of GBP120.5 million (R2 189 million) at 30 June
2018.

Consolidation of Discovery Unit Trusts

The Discovery Unit Trusts are consolidated into Discovery's results for accounting purposes, which results in the recognition of the underlying assets and liabilities of
each of the funds.

Assets and liabilities of the Discovery Unit Trusts increased by R7 689 million respectively compared to the prior financial year with movements in the following line
items on the Group's Statement of financial position:
- Investments at fair value through profit or loss increased by R8 269 million.
- Investment contracts at fair value through profit or loss increased by R7 836 million.
- Cash and cash equivalents decreased by R617 million.
- Trade and other payables decreased by R144 million.
- Other assets increased by R37 million.
- Other liabilities decreased by R3 million.

As these policies are linked, the consolidation of the Discovery Unit Trusts has no impact on the net asset value for Discovery shareholders.

Other significant items in these results

Material transactions with related parties

Discovery Health administers the Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) and provides managed care services for which it charges an administration fee and a
managed healthcare fee respectively. These fees are determined on an annual basis and approved by the trustees of DHMS. The fees totalled R5 496 million for the
year ended 30 June 2018 (2017: R5 090 million). Discovery offers the members of DHMS access to the Vitality programme.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss have increased by R12.3 billion due to market growth and the sale of Discovery Invest products. This includes the
impact of consolidating the Discovery Unit Trusts into the Group's results. The increase in the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss has been presented in
'Purchase of investments held to back policyholder liabilities' of R24 217 million in the Statement of cash flows.

Deferred tax

With the promulgation of the South African Insurance Act 18 of 2017, in January 2018, the new 'adjusted IFRS' tax basis, effective 1 July 2018, has been substantively
enacted as at 30 June 2018. As a result, deferred tax has been calculated on this basis and reflects the values at which the tax liabilities will ultimately be settled. A
reduction in the deferred tax liability of R119 million has been recognised as a timing difference, and has been adjusted for in the calculation of normalised headline
earnings.

During the current year a deferred tax asset has been recognised on the assessed loss in Discovery Insure. Further amounts were raised during the current year in
respect of the VitalityHealth assessed losses. These amounted to R243 million and R109 million respectively, and have been added back in the calculation of normalised
headline earnings.

Taxation

For South African entities that are in a tax paying position, tax has been provided at 28% (2017: 28%) in the financial statements. Where an entity is in an assessed loss
position, a deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be future taxable profits against which assessed losses can be utilised.

Events after reporting date

Banking

As detailed in the operating commentary, subsequent to balance sheet date, Discovery and FirstRand Investment Holdings Limited (FRIHL) have agreed that it would be
preferable for FRIHL to exit their shareholding in Discovery Bank as soon as practically possible.

The proposed transaction includes:

(i)   the acquisition of the effective 25.01% interest of FRIHL in Discovery Bank
(ii)  acquiring the remaining 25.01% economic interest that FirstRand Bank currently owns in the Discovery Card joint venture business
(iii) Discovery Bank acquiring all rights to the Discovery card book and related assets which will be migrated over time

The transaction is subject to approval by the regulatory authorities including The Chief Executive Officer of the Prudential Authority, SARB and The Competition
Authorities.

The total combined acquisition price payable by Discovery to the FirstRand Group will be R1.8 billion. Since the acquisition of the remaining 25% constitutes a new
initiative and presents an important opportunity for the Discovery Group, the Board have decided that this acquisition should be funded by way of an equity issuance,
limited to the purchase price. Given the relative immateriality, the transaction does not require shareholder approval.

Listed debt issue

On 29 August 2018, as part of its ongoing capital management process, Discovery Limited issued further Floating Rate Notes in terms of its Domestic Medium Term Note
Programme (DMTN) totalling R700 million. Capital repayment is on maturity date being 21 August 2026. The coupon interest rate in respect of the notes is linked to 3
month JIBAR plus 180bps, with interest payable quarterly in arrears. Interest rate have been fixed at 10.29% per annum, through interest rate swaps. This brings the
total nominal value in issue under the DMTN programme to R2.2 billion.

Basis of preparation

The summary consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports,
and the requirements of the Companies Act applicable to summary financial statements. The Listings Requirements require preliminary reports to be prepared in
accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA
Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and
to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements from which the summary consolidated financial statements were derived are in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards and are
consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual financial statements.

Audit

The summary consolidated financial statements are extracted from audited information, but are not audited. The annual financial statements were audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., who expressed an unmodified opinion thereon.

The audited annual financial statements and the auditor's report thereon are available for inspection at the company's registered office, together with the financial
statements identified in the respective auditor's reports.

The directors of Discovery take full responsibility for the preparation of this report and that the financial information has been correctly extracted from the underlying
annual financial statements.

Embedded value statement
for the year ended 30 June 2018

The embedded value of Discovery consists of the following components:
- the adjusted net worth attributed to the business at the valuation date;
- plus: the present value of expected future shareholder cash flows from the in-force covered business;
- less: the cost of required capital.

The present value of future shareholder cash flows from the in-force covered business is calculated as the value of projected future after-tax shareholder cash flows of
the business in-force at the valuation date, discounted at the risk discount rate.

The required capital are the assets attributed to the covered business above the amount required to back covered business liabilities, whose distribution to
shareholders is restricted as they are allocated to cover regulatory and internal capital requirements.

The value of new business is the present value, at the point of sale, of the projected future after-tax shareholder cash flows of the new business written by Discovery,
discounted at the risk discount rate, less an allowance for the reserving strain, initial expenses and cost of required capital. The value of new business is calculated
using the current reporting date assumptions.

For Discovery Life, the shareholder cash flows are based on the release of margins under the Statutory Valuation Method (""SVM"") basis.

The embedded value includes the insurance and administration profits of the covered business in the Discovery Limited group. Covered business includes business
written in South Africa through Discovery Life (""Life""), Discovery Invest (""Invest""), Discovery Health (""Health"") and Discovery Vitality (""Vitality""), and in the United Kingdom
through VitalityLife and VitalityHealth. For Vitality Group, Ping An Health, MyOwn Health, Discovery Insure and VitaltyInvest, no published value has been placed on the
current in-force business as the businesses have not yet reached suitable scale with predictable experience.

In August 2011, Discovery raised R800 million through the issue of non-cumulative, non-participating, non-convertible preference shares. For embedded value purposes
this capital, net of share issue expenses, has been excluded from the adjusted net worth.

(1) A breakdown of the adjustment to shareholders' funds is shown in the table below. An additional adjustment has been included as at
    30 June 2018 to reverse the IAS 17 accounting treatment of the 1 Discovery Place lease contract. Future rental payments in respect of the
    covered businesses under the lease are capitalised in the value of in-force for covered business, consistent with the treatment of other
    renewal expenses. Note that where relevant, adjustments have been converted using the closing exchange rate of R18.16/GBP (June 2017:

    The excess of available regulatory capital over adjusted net worth reflects the difference between the adjusted net
    worth and the available regulatory capital. This includes the net preference share capital of R779 million which is
    included as available regulatory capital. At 30 June 2018, this adjustment also includes the difference between Vitality
    Life Limited's Solvency II Pillar 1 Own Funds and its adjusted net worth and adds back the negative reserves eliminated
    on the Discovery funded VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence.

    The required capital at June 2018 for Life is R1 732 million (June 2017: R1 409 million), for Health and Vitality is
    R840 million (June 2017: R797 million), for VitalityHealth is R2 133 million (June 2017: R1 984 million) and for VitalityLife
    is R4 210 million (June 2017: R2 951 million). For Life, the required capital was set equal to two times the statutory
    Capital Adequacy Requirement. For Health and Vitality, the required capital was set equal to two times the monthly
    renewal expense and Vitality benefit cost. For VitalityHealth, the required capital amount was set equal to 1.35 times
    (previously 1.4 times) the Solvency II Pillar 1 Solvency Capital Requirement. For the VitalityLife business on the
    Prudential licence, the required capital was set equal to the UK Solvency I long term insurance capital requirement as
    per the agreement with Prudential. For the business sold on the Vitality Life Limited licence, the required capital was set
    equal to the excess of 1.4 times the Solvency II Pillar 1 Solvency Capital Requirement. The Regulatory Required Capital
    is calculated as the relevant regulatory solvency capital requirement for each insurance business.

(3) The diluted embedded value per share allows for Discovery's BEE transaction where the impact is dilutive i.e. where the
    current embedded value per share exceeds the current transaction value.

(1) The changes in methodology and assumptions will vary over time to reflect adjustments to the model and assumptions as a result of changes to the operating
    and economic environment. The current period's changes are described in detail in Table 6 below (for previous periods refer to previous embedded
    value statements).
(2) This item reflects the amortisation of the intangible assets reflecting the DiscoveryCard profit share arrangement, banking costs and the PrimeMed acquisition.
(3) This item includes costs of start-up businesses and expenses incurred to investigate new products and markets. Start-up costs include costs in relation to the
    Discovery Bank, the recently launched UK investment business, Vitality Invest, a commercial offering in Discovery Insure, and an Umbrella Fund offering in
    Discovery Invest. Head office costs which relate to non-covered business are also included in this item.
(4) This item includes once-off costs relating to systems development spend in Discovery Health.
(5) Acquisition costs relate to commission paid on the VitalityLife and Life business and expenses incurred in writing Health and Vitality business that has been
    written over the period but will only be activated and on risk after the valuation date. These policies are not included in the embedded value or the value of new
    business and therefore the costs are not deducted from the value of new business.
(6) This item includes, among other items, the tax benefits or losses that will emerge as the VitalityHealth DAC and intangible software assets amortise or increase.
(7) The return on shareholders' funds is shown net of tax and management charges.

(1) The mortality and morbidity experience for VitalityHealth arises due to improvements in risk management, sales and retention models, claim payment
    processes, and an increase in Vitality engagement, resulting in lower experience loss ratios over those expected.
(2) The premium and fee income experience for Health and Vitality reflects the impact on administration and managed care fees due to the in-period inflation being
    lower than that assumed.
(3) The tax variance for Life and Invest arises due to a movement in the deferred tax asset which delays the payment of tax.
(4) The projection term for Health and Vitality, Group Life and VitalityHealth at 30 June 2018 has not been changed from that used in the 30 June 2017 embedded
    value calculation. Therefore, an experience variance arises because the total term of the in-force covered business is effectively increased by twelve months.

(1) For Life and Invest, the modelling change item includes a change to the projection term limit of the value of in-force from valuing shareholder cash flows over
    their full term to a shorter 40 year projection term. VitalityHealth changed their methodology to calculate the value in-force from 30 June 2018. Under the new
    methodology, the value in-force at the valuation date is derived as the in-force written premium multiplied by the Margin multiplied by the Annuity Factor. The
    assumptions for the Margin and Annuity Factor are shown in Table 8.
(2) For Health and Vitality, the expenses item reflects a revision to the renewal expense assumption in light of the lower in-period inflation relative to expected.
(3) An increase was made to the Life lapse rate as a proxy for the impact of net policy alterations.
(4) The South African investment return assumptions for Life, Invest, Health and Vitality were changed from being applied in the model as a single interest rate to
    the full yield curve. Consistent with this, the real yield assumption was set relative to the observed real yield curve, adjusted to remove volatility due to the
    nature of the index linked government bond market. VitalityLife have adopted a passive investment return and real yield assumption, with the assumptions
    remaining fixed unless market conditions depart significantly from the assumptions at the financial year end.
(5) For Life the reinsurance item primarily relates to the impact of the financing reinsurance arrangements.
(6) For VitalityLife, the other item relates to the margin reset to offset acquisition costs and assumption and methodology changes, as per the accounting policy, and
    an alignment of the compulsory margins in VitalityLife to those used by Life.

(1) Health new business annualised premium income is the gross contribution to the medical schemes. The new business annualised
    premium income shown above excludes premiums in respect of members who join an existing employer where the member has no
    choice of medical scheme, as well as premiums in respect of new business written during the period but only activated after
    30 June 2018.
    The total Health and Vitality new business annualised premium income written over the period was R6 735 million (June 2017:
    R6 276 million).
(2) Included in the Life and Invest embedded value of new business is R110 million (June 2017: R109 million) in respect of investment
    management services provided on off balance sheet investment business.
    Risk business written prior to the valuation date allows certain Invest business to be written at financially advantageous terms, the
    impact of which has been recognised in the value of new business.
(3) Life new business is defined as Life policies to which Life became contractually bound during the reporting period, including policies
    whose first premium is due after the valuation date. Invest new business is defined as business where at least one premium has been
    received and which has not been refunded after receipt. Invest new business also includes Discovery Retirement Optimiser policies to
    which Life and Invest became contractually bound during the reporting period, including policies whose first premium is due after the
    valuation date.

    R4 671 million) (single premium APE: R1 248 million (June 2017: R1 277 million)). Single premium business is included at 10%
    of the value of the single premium.
    Policy alterations and internal replacement policies, including Discovery Retirement Optimisers added to existing Life Plans, are shown
    in Table 5 as experience variances and not included as new business. Term extensions on existing contracts are not included as
    new business.
(4) The annualised profit margin is the value of new business expressed as a percentage of the present value of future premiums.
(5) The VitalityHealth value of new business is calculated as the value at point of sale of the new business written premium in-force at the
    valuation date multiplied by the Margin multiplied by the Annuity Factor less the new business cash flows from point of sale to the
    valuation date. The assumptions for the Margin and Annuity Factor are shown in Table 8.
(6) VitalityHealth new business is defined as individuals and employer groups which incepted during the reporting period. The new

(1) Derived as a margin over (or below for cash) the respective pre-tax investment return for bonds.
(2) The inflation assumption is derived as the difference between the nominal and real yield curve at each duration.
    As an indication, the cash flow weighted average inflation is shown in the table.
(3) As indications, the cash flow weighted averages derived from the relevant yield curve(s) are shown.
(4) The United Kingdom Corporation tax rate assumed is 20% in 2017, 19% in 2018 to 2020, and 17% beyond that.
(5) The VitalityHealth projection term of 20 years is used in the derivation of the Annuity Factor.

The Discovery Limited embedded value is calculated based on a risk discount rate using the CAPM approach with specific reference to the Discovery beta coefficient.
The assumed beta is fixed at 0.75. This has been set such that the risk discount rate proxies the result of a Weighted Average Cost of Capital approach with reference to
the capital structure of the Group and the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time period. The observed beta is calculated with reference to the
ALSI. The assumed beta will only change if the capital structure of the Group and/or the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time period suggest
the beta assumption should depart significantly from the assumption at the financial year end. As beta values reflect the historic performance of share prices relative to
the market they may not allow fully for non-market related and non-financial risk. Investors may want to form their own view on an appropriate allowance for these
risks which have not been modelled explicitly.

Life and Invest mortality, morbidity, lapse and surrender assumptions were derived from internal experience, where available, augmented by reinsurance and industry
information.

The Health and Vitality lapse assumptions were derived from the results of recent experience investigations.

The VitalityHealth assumptions were derived from internal experience.

VitalityLife assumptions were derived from internal experience, where available, augmented by reinsurance, industry and Discovery Limited group information.
Renewal expense assumptions were based on the results of the latest expense and budget information.

The initial expenses included in the calculation of the embedded value of new business are the actual costs incurred excluding expenses of an exceptional or
non-recurring nature.

From 30 June 2018, the South African investment return assumptions for Life, Invest, Health and Vitality were based on the publicly available Prudential Authority
risk-free nominal yield curve. The real yield assumption was set based on the publicly available Prudential Authority risk-free real yield curve, adjusted to remove
volatility due to the nature of the index linked government bond market. Other economic assumptions were set relative to these two yield curves. The 30 June 2017
investment return assumptions, and other related economic assumptions, were based on a single interest rate derived from the risk-free zero coupon government
bond yield curve.

The current and projected tax position of the policyholder funds within the Life company has been taken into account in determining the net investment return
assumption.

The best estimate investment return assumption for VitalityHealth was based on the single interest rate derived from the risk-free zero coupon sterling yield curve.

From 30 June 2018, VitalityHealth calculate the value in-force at the valuation date as the in-force written premium multiplied by the Margin multiplied by the Annuity
Factor, as set out in the table above. The Annuity Factor assumption is derived from assumed future lapse rates and premium increases. The Margin assumption
reflects profit margins after tax and Cost of Capital. The assumptions underlying the Annuity Factor and Margin are set taking into account the current experience in the
business at different durations.

VitalityLife adopts a passive approach for setting economic assumptions. The nominal investment return and real return rate are fixed unless market conditions depart
significantly from the assumptions at the financial year end. Other economic assumptions were set relative to these two passive yields.

It is assumed that, for the purposes of calculating the cost of required capital, the Life and Invest required capital amount will be backed by surplus assets consisting of
100% equities and the Health, Vitality, and VitalityHealth required capital amounts will be fully backed by cash. Vitality Life Limited and the VitalityLife business on the
Prudential licence required capital amount is assumed to earn the same return as the assets backing the VitalityLife policyholder liabilities. Allowance has been made
for tax and investment expenses in the calculation of the cost of required capital. In calculating the capital gains tax liability, it is assumed that the portfolio is realised
every 5 years. The Life and Invest cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the gross of tax equity return and the equity return net of tax and
expenses. The Health, Vitality, and VitalityHealth cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the risk discount rate and the net of tax cash return.
Vitality Life Limited and the VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the risk discount rate and
the net of tax asset return assumption.

The embedded value has been calculated in accordance with the Actuarial Society of South Africa's Advisory Practice Note (""APN"") 107: Embedded Value Reporting,
except the recommended disclosure of Free Surplus and Required Capital has been adjusted to take into account the revised capital requirements and resources
arising from Solvency II in the United Kingdom as can be seen in Table 1 note 2.

Sensitivity to the embedded value assumptions

The risk discount rate uses the CAPM approach with specific reference to the Discovery beta coefficient. As beta values reflect the historic performance of share prices relative to the market they may not allow fully for non-market related and
non-financial risk. Investors may want to form their own view on an appropriate allowance for these risks which have not been modelled explicitly. The sensitivity of the embedded value and the embedded value of new business at 30 June 2018 to
changes in the risk discount rate is included in the tables below.

For each sensitivity illustrated below, all other assumptions have been left unchanged. No allowance has been made for management action such as risk premium increases where future experience is worse than the base assumptions.

TRADING STATEMENT: YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018

In accordance with paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Listings Requirements, issuers must publish a trading
statement as soon as they have a reasonable degree of certainty that earnings per share and / or
headline earnings per share for the next reporting period will differ by at least 20% from that of the
previous corresponding period.

Shareholders are advised that:
- Headline earnings per share (undiluted) for the year ended 30 June 2018 (“current period”) is
  expected to increase in the range of 30% to 35%, to between 888 cents and 922 cents over the
  prior year ended 30 June 2017 (“prior period”) (2017: 683.1 cents); and
- Earnings per share (undiluted) is expected to increase in the range of 25% to 30%, to between 855
  cents and 889 cents (2017: 684.2 cents) over the prior period.

It is practice for the Company to issue a trading statement on “normalised” headline earnings per share,
which in management’s view best represents the underlying performance of the Group.

Accordingly, shareholders are advised that:
- Normalised profit from operations is expected to increase by between 15% and 20% in the current
  period over the prior period to between R8.1 billion and R8.5 billion (2017: R7.0 billion); and
- Normalised headline earnings per share (undiluted) is expected to increase in the range of 13% to
  18%, to between 816 cents and 852 cents over the prior period (2017: 722.2 cents).

Discovery’s results for the year are due to be released on SENS on 4 September 2018.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported
on by the Company’s external auditors.

Commentary

Strong Group performance and acceleration towards 2018 Ambition

Discovery's performance over the six months ended 31 December 2017 exceeded expectation, enabling it to track strongly towards its stated 2018 Ambition.
Normalised operating profit increased by 19% to R4 059 million; normalised headline earnings increased by 30% to R2 829 million; and core new business Annualised
Premium Income (API) (which excludes Discovery Health's take-on of new closed medical schemes and gross revenue of Vitality Group) increased by 16% to R9 303
million. The Embedded Value grew by 13% on an annualised basis to R60.4 billion.

Over the period, the Group continued to make substantive progress against all three Ambition criteria:

1) Financial and social impact, targeting R10 billion in normalised profit from operations, with growth of CPI + 10%; return on capital of risk-free + 10%; and making 10
   million people around the world healthier.

2) A unique foundation, comprising a sophisticated data and science capability; an aspirational global Vitality brand; exceptional talent, particularly in terms of critical
   skills; and an entrenched values-based culture.

3) Brilliant businesses that are 1) insurgent in their markets; 2) offer sustainable products that meet complex consumer needs; 3) generate excellent member
   engagement; 4) deliver superior actuarial dynamics; and 5) offer an exceptional service ecosystem.

In terms of financial impact, the Group surpassed its growth methodology targets. The established businesses delivered combined growth in operating profit of 15%
- well above the guidance of CPI + 5%; the emerging businesses exceeded their target of CPI + 30%, and 8% of earnings was invested in new initiatives, including
Discovery Bank, Umbrella Funds, Vitality Invest, and Discovery Insure Commercial Insurance - all of which are within budget and on track for launch in 2018.

The Group also continued to meet the requirements of its capital allocation model in terms of solvency capital, allocated capital, and maintaining an above-guidance
buffer of R2.5 billion as at 31 December 2017. During the period, Discovery came to market for its inaugural Domestic Medium Term Note issuance to diversify its
funding sources, and this was oversubscribed. The Financial Leverage Ratio (FLR) as at 31 December 2017 was 26.5%, remaining below the limit of 28%.

The third tier of Discovery's operating model is its cash management approach. The Group generated R6.1 billion in cash, and after payment of tax, dividends and
interest on debt, invested R3.8 billion in new business and R1.1 billion in new initiatives. Both these investments meet the criteria of risk-free + 10%, validating the
approach to continue to invest significantly without breaching the FLR or cash buffer.

The above financial performance illustrates how the 2018 Ambition has been instrumental in framing and driving financial outcomes and scale since 2013. During the
currency of the Ambition, sizeable businesses (Discovery Invest, VitalityLife and VitalityHealth) moved into the established category; high-potential businesses (Discovery
Insure, Ping An Health and Vitality Group) became emerging; and ongoing investment took place in new ventures to ensure a pipeline for future growth.

Discovery's unique foundation and Shared-Value Insurance model - the manifestation of its core purpose - continued to create competitive advantage across markets,
in spite of economic complexity and volatility. Considerable investment took place through the Global Vitality Network (GVN), ensuring repeatability and scalability
across adjacencies and geographies. Among the GVN's activities and initiatives, three notable developments include:

Firstly, from an architecture perspective, progress was made towards a universal behavioural platform through a common status and points currency that manifests in
a simple, digital user journey based on Active Rewards. This is being powered by a configurable global technology platform - Vitality One - currently tracking over 1 000
activities and 50 biometric readings every minute.

Secondly, Vitality Active Rewards with Apple Watch continued to exemplify Discovery's sophisticated data and science asset, leveraging the Group's two decades of
expertise in behaviour change to drive powerful changes in risk and lifestyle. Vitality members using the Apple Watch benefit across SA, the UK and the US have shown
consistent and sustained increases in engagement and behaviour change (35% - 100% more active following take-up of benefit; 22% - 63% more active in the long run).

Thirdly, as an evolution of its healthy ageing agenda, Discovery completed work to quantify the most influential interventions that extend life and quality of life at older
ages, and this is being consolidated into a sophisticated wellness product. In addition, these insights are being used to shape a retirement planning proposition
incorporating financial security and wellness; with learnings being applied to Vitality Invest's impending launch in the UK.

Finally, the businesses continued to make progress against their Group-set performance measures.


Performance of established businesses


Discovery Health

Discovery Health delivered excellent results for the period to 31 December 2017, with normalised operating profit increasing by 12% to R1 332 million; new business
API increasing by 10% to R3 324 million (excluding take-on of new closed schemes); and lives under management reaching 3.44 million. Discovery Health Medical
Scheme (DHMS) also performed excellently, announcing a highly-competitive contribution increase of 7.9%.

Discovery Health's ongoing investment in risk management assets and systems ensured that DHMS ended the calendar year with a surplus of R2.45 billion, taking
solvency to 27.45% of gross contributions - well above the statutory level of 25%. DHMS is now in the strongest financial position in its history, with membership of 2.78
million lives at year-end. Discovery Health is also creating ongoing value for its schemes - in 2016 alone, Discovery Health saved DHMS R6.2 billion through its managed
care initiatives and Vitality programme, equating to 14% savings in risk claims.

Over the period, Discovery Health continued to grow its restricted medical scheme client base, now at 18 with over 660 000 lives under management. Immediately
following the review period, Discovery Health was awarded the tender for BP Medical Aid Society, to be administered by DH from 1 July 2018.

Discovery Health has made significant investments in initiatives aimed at maintaining and improving the quality of care, including programmes tailored to members
with diabetes, heart disease, kidney failure and those undergoing joint replacement surgery - all with demonstrative outcomes. In addition, Discovery Health's
investment in technology and expertise to address medical scheme fraud led to recoveries of over R538 million for its client medical schemes during the 2017 calendar
year. The business also made significant new investments in big data analytics and artificial intelligence capabilities.

Finally, several innovative changes were developed for the 2018 DHMS and Discovery Health launch. These included benefit changes to enhance cover for young
families; extending the Vitality programme to lower-income segments; and introducing a fully-integrated corporate health offering.

Discovery Health maintains its strong support for the objectives of the proposed National Health Insurance (NHI), and continues to work closely with the National
Department of Health and other stakeholders to ensure optimal outcomes of the NHI policy process. Discovery Health also continues to participate actively in the
processes of the Health Market Inquiry of the Competition Commission, which is expected to report its findings in the latter half of 2018.


Discovery Life

Over the period, Discovery Life continued to utilise the Shared-Value Insurance model to maintain its market-leading position. New business API increased by 6% to R1
121 million and earnings increased by 4% to R1 839 million, despite the impact of claims volatility. Market share increased to 27.5%(1) in the retail affluent protection
segment, while the value of new business grew by 11%, reflecting a continued focus on quality of new business.

The second quarter of the financial year saw a rapid acceleration in new business, driven by the annual product launch, with Individual new business increasing by 7%
compared with the same quarter in the prior year. The launch of the new Global Education Protector, Vitality Purple and the Purple Plan range has been very well
received. Annual premiums collected exceeded R10 billion for the first time.

The higher-than-expected claims experience was due primarily to a small, but increased, number of large non-natural deaths and claims. Apart from this, the business
delivered positive experience variances across both expenses and lapses, with policy lapses at 87% of expectation, emphasising the value of integration.

The clinical refinement of the Vitality points structure, which was accelerated over the period, has resulted in strong health behaviour change, as clients strive to
maintain their integration benefits (PayBacks of R511 million were paid to policyholders) - demonstrating the efficacy of the Shared-Value Insurance model. This is
further validated by an independent reinsurance report showing a distinction between Discovery Life's population and the rest of the industry.

Discovery Life remains well-capitalised at 3.8x CAR and generated cash of R1.9 billion (including Discovery Invest) from the inforce book over the period (before
reinsurance and acquisition-related costs). It invested the majority of this in new business growth, ending in a net cash generation of R354 million.

Discovery Invest

The business performed strongly over the period. While new business decreased by 5%, reflecting an environment of weakened inflows, Discovery Invest's net flows
grew by 20% to R3.3 billion. Its gross LISP flows market share increased from 4.3% to 5.2% for the six months compared to the same prior period. Operating profit grew
29% to R419 million, driven by growth in assets under administration of 22% to R77.8 billion, with 77% of linked funds in Discovery funds, and an improvement in the
value of new business since June 2017.

The Discovery Balanced Fund continued to perform well and remains in the top 10 retail flow taking SA Unit Trusts in each quarter for the past two years. In the
PlexCrown Ratings, a widely-quoted unit trust rating agency in SA, Discovery Invest climbed from 12th to 4th place (out of 17) in the final quarter of 2017 - Discovery's
highest rating to date.

The recent product launch saw the introduction of investment offerings tailored to specific client segments. This included a more accessible product for younger clients;
an enhanced offering for clients who reinvest their Discovery Life cash back; and a Purple range with unique benefits targeted to high net worth clients.


Discovery Card

The Discovery Card business exceeded expectation. Profits for the Discovery Card JV with FNB grew by 16% to R207 million and revenue increased by 7% to R500
million.

Discovery's credit card base is less sensitive to negative market conditions due to a substantially better risk profile. The credit loss ratio to advances was 1.5% compared
to the market average of 6% for tier 1 credit providers. Over the period, turnover spend on the Discovery Card was up 4.6% and advances were up 3.8%.


Vitality UK

Discovery's UK business, comprising VitalityLife and VitalityHealth, continued to deliver robust results during the period under review. Combined new business sales
grew 6% to a record £61.0 million (R1 079 million); and operating profit grew 55% to £35 million (R616 million). Insured lives exceed one million members.

The UK business continued its strategic development, with significant investment made to enhance the resonance and reach of the Vitality brand; the adoption and
impact of Vitality; the relevance of the product construct to members given emerging risk profiles and needs; the move towards greater digitisation and use of
self-servicing channels; and to more extensively deliver the composite Discovery model in the UK.

Significant progress was made in each of these areas. Prompted brand awareness reached nearly 50%, accompanied by significant growth in business derived through
direct channels; and engagement in Vitality increased by 58% to over 30 million activities in the 2017 calendar year. The business launched Vitality Kids in partnership
with Disney, a new Healthy Mind component of Vitality, and new digital platforms. Finally, Vitality UK received regulatory approval for the launch of a long-term savings
business during 2018, which will leverage behavioural learnings from the UK, as well as the experience of Discovery Invest in South Africa.


VitalityLife

VitalityLife showed a resilient half-year performance with normalised operating profit increasing by 2% to £14.8 million - a positive result considering the low interest
rate environment and negative impact of higher-than-expected lapses. New business sales were £31.5 million, 4% lower than the comparative prior year volumes.
VitalityLife has reconfigured and priced its business for a low-interest-rate environment, with a focus on Term products and Vitality integration. As a result, sales
performance picked up strongly in the second quarter of the financial year.

The fundamentals of the VitalityLife business remained strong over the period, with claims ratios below expectation (both gross and net of reinsurance). The steady and
continued adoption of the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model (Vitality-linked products comprise approximately 73% of new business), has been a key driver of the
increasing value of new business margin, which improved to 49% (compared with an H1 2017 margin of 36%). VitalityLife's continued product innovation saw a drive
towards more capital-efficient products with a focus on business mix.


VitalityHealth

VitalityHealth recorded an excellent half-year performance across new business, claims, loss ratio and operating profit. New business was 18% higher than the prior
period, at £29.5 million, with continued strong growth in the more profitable individual (+14%) and SME (+13%) markets. Operating profit of £20.1 million was up from
£8 million for the comparative period in the prior year, on the back of a continuing strong loss ratio and tight control of operating expenses. The business was also
strongly cash flow positive, generating £47.7 million of cash from the inforce book, relative to acquisition costs of £21.8 million, resulting in a net cash position of £25.9
million for the six months.

Notably, there was a significant improvement in the quality of business both written and retained. This was driven by greater sophistication in the application of the
value over volume approach; the impact of Vitality on member selection; and targeted retention strategies. In addition, claims performed well as a result of the
combined effect of the improved risk profile of new business; sophisticated care pathways that enhance member experience and quality of care, at reduced cost per
claim; and increased levels of wellness engagement that have resulted in a reduction in member risk across the book.

In addition, the business continued to invest in digital assets essential to achieving service ambitions, including sophisticated machine learning techniques in sales and
retention. These investments will ensure the business keeps up with changing member demands, removes barriers to engagement and creates cost efficiencies across
service operations.

Performance of emerging businesses


Discovery Insure

Discovery Insure delivered a profit of R29 million for the six months, with Gross Premium Income growing 30% to R1.3 billion, and new business increasing by 22% with
R495 million in API written in the period. The business is also growing at five times the rate of the South African short-term insurance industry growth rate.

The excellent performance over the period was driven by the continued progress of the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model, as well as management efficiencies.
Premium income growth continued to exceed total claims plus expenses growth, leading to the strong emergence of operating profit.

Offering a competitive premium, telematics and exceptional rewards for good driving behaviour has resulted in: 1) selection of better risks; 2) behaviour change, with a
significant improvement in driver scores; 3) lower claims frequency and severity; and 4) selective lapsation, evidenced by a shift to higher driver scores over time. This
has culminated in a low loss ratio and appealing value of new business, leading to the existing Discovery Insure book (excluding the impact of new business) producing
R99 million in profit over the six months.

Discovery Insure has codified its model and data asset (with over 200 000 clients insured as at February 2018 and more than six billion kilometres of driving data). The
business is exploring the opportunity to extend the model into the commercial and fleet insurance market in 2018, as well as into international markets as an extension
of the Global Vitality Network.


Vitality Group

Vitality Group produced strong results, with significant growth in Insurance Partner Markets, and Vitality membership growing by 49% to over 1.7 million. The business
has broken even in its own right, with operating profit of $0.1 million, largely driven by new business growth of insurance partners and efficiencies gained from merging
the US and SA international operations. Vitality Group is also investing substantially in the Vitality One Platform, which will enable accelerated rollout of innovation
across the world.

The financial dynamics of Vitality Group involve a largely fixed cost base and rapidly-growing fee income from insurance partners (up 39% over the half-year). This gives
Discovery confidence that Vitality Group will reach its target of achieving R300 million to R500 million operating profit (including Ping An Health) in two to four years'
time.

There have been substantial efforts to develop partnerships with additional insurers in Latin America, Europe and Asia, under Vitality Group's partnership with
Hannover Re. There is a strong pipeline of insurers at different stages of the sales process. Vitality Group has already concluded one new partnership with a launch
planned before the end of FY2018, and aims to conclude another partnership in the same timeframe.


AIA Vitality

AIA had record sales with a profound increase in membership, which grew by 63%, and engagement in Vitality by 12%. Revenue from AIA integrated products increased
by 18% and some AIA markets now offer more than twice the number of integrated products compared to a year ago.


Generali

Generali continued to see strong sales, positive media reaction and high client engagement in Germany, France and Austria. Over the period Annualised Premium
Equivalent grew by 8%, total membership grew by 45%, and engagement grew by 5%. Substantial growth is expected following the January launch of Vitality to the
Deutsche Vermogensberatung network in Germany, which services six million clients.


John Hancock and Manulife

These businesses produced a strong result, with API growing 26% over the period; membership up 160%; and a notable increase in engagement after the launch of the
Apple Watch benefit.


Vitality USA

The corporate wellness business performed well during the period, contributing $1 million to Vitality Group profits. As Vitality USA continues to create value for US
employers by improving employee health promotion, it is also focused on expanding its future customer base beyond employers, by investigating opportunities to
serve other stakeholders interested in incentivising health and wellness behaviours among consumers.


Ping An Health

Ping An Health (PAH) continued to perform exceptionally over the six months, with membership growing by 60% from 1 July 2017. Discovery's interest in PAH is now
profitable, with operating profit of R36 million (an increase of 500%) for the period. This substantial growth was driven by the success of e-Sheng Bao (high deductible
health cover sold largely online), which contributed more than 68% of the R2 billion in new business volumes during the period. Ping An Health's distribution model
with the Ping An Group (PAG) is changing as PAH leverages its reinsurance licence to participate directly in sales, enabling it to access PAG's full distribution network.
This will result in higher new business strain as the reinsured book builds.

The opportunity in China is compelling, with private health insurance set to grow substantially given the underdeveloped market; favourable government policies; and
demographic trends, including an ageing society. Ping An Health is set to take advantage of this opportunity, with access to a massive distribution network throughout
Ping An, and a segmented product suite consisting of internet, Group high-end, and intermediate offerings. Ping An Health is also prioritising product development,
operations and technology capabilities, while PAG is investing heavily in broader healthcare assets, which will work in harmony with PAH. Discovery continues to
support PAH through its health insurance expertise.

Furthermore, PAH is growing its own distribution channels to sustain this rapid growth. In support of this, it opened two branches during the period, collectively
covering a population of almost 20 million people, with plans to open two additional branches during the first half of 2018.

Vitality continues to gain traction throughout Ping An. The membership of Vitality Active Rewards within Ping An Life passed the three-million-member mark within 14
months of launching. There are now more Vitality members in China than any country where Vitality is present.


New initiatives


Discovery Bank

On 16 October 2017, Discovery Bank was granted a banking licence from the Registrar of Banks in terms of the Banks Act, Act No. 94 of 1990 and the South African
Reserve Bank (SARB) subsequently published in the Government Gazette, on Friday 10 November 2017, the granting of a banking licence to Discovery Bank.

As previously announced, the licence is subject to certain conditions imposed by the Registrar relating to the shareholding in Discovery Bank. Shareholders of the Bank
are currently in discussions to agree how best to manage these conditions. The proposed purchase of the Discovery-branded FirstRand Bank-issued credit card
business and book is subject to Competition Commission approval. The outcome of the above-mentioned discussions may also potentially impact this approval.

Over the six-month period, management worked alongside regulators and industry associations to obtain the required licences and perform associated testing. The
support of these regulatory and industry bodies enabled Discovery Bank to build and demonstrate compliance in parallel with obtaining a bank licence. The alternative
would have required obtaining a licence and only thereafter being eligible to join the various fora and prove capability. This would have resulted in considerable extra
time and costs.

In addition to its banking licence, Discovery Bank has received the following licences/memberships:

- National Credit Act (NCA), which facilitates the advancement of credit to the public.

- SAMOS (South African Multiple Options Settlement), which allows Discovery Bank to settle transactions with other banks within South Africa; and enables it to be a
  settlement bank from date of launch.

- SWIFT (Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication), which allows Discovery Bank to transact on the SAMOS systems with the SARB.

- PASA (Payments System of South Africa), reflecting that the business is able to conform to the rules and conventions necessary to process specified payments, e.g.
  EFT transactions, debit orders.

- Visa Principal Issuer licence, with Discovery Bank receiving its globally unique six-digit BIN-number for both credit and debit cards.

- 'Restricted Authorised Dealer in Foreign Exchange' granted by the Financial Surveillance Department of the SARB Exchange Control.

Discovery Bank is testing its capabilities with live testing of system infrastructure, operating processes and regulatory engagement. Discovery will launch its proposed
banking offering to the public during 2018. Spend to date is R1.2 billion and this is expected to reach R1.5 billion by launch.

Prospects for growth

Prospects for continued growth are compelling. Discovery's established businesses are all well positioned in their respective markets, its emerging businesses are
insurgent, and four substantial businesses will be launched during 2018. This gives the Group confidence of ongoing growth and performance into the future.

Any forecast financial information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's external auditors.

Fair value hierarchy of financial instruments

The Group's financial instruments measured at fair value have been disclosed using a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy has three levels that reflect the significance of
the inputs used in measuring fair value. These are as follows:

Level 1 includes financial instruments that are measured using unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for identical financial instruments. Quoted prices are
readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly
occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.

Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data. Instruments in this category are valued using:
(a) quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which are not considered to be active or

(b) valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.

Level 3 includes financial instruments that are valued using valuation techniques that incorporate information other than observable market data and where at least
one input (which could have a significant effect on instruments' valuation) cannot be based on observable market data.

                                                                                                    31 December 2017

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments in level 2

- Discovery has invested in equity linked notes offered by international banks in order to back certain unit-linked contract liabilities. The calculation of the daily value of
  the equity linked investments is made by the provider of the note. Discovery has procedures in place to ensure that these prices are correct. Aside from the daily
  reasonableness checks versus similar funds and movement since the prior day's price, the fund values are calculated with reference to a specific formula or index,
  disclosed to the policyholders, which is recalculated by Discovery in order to check if the price provided by the provider is correct.

- If a quoted market price is not available on a recognised stock exchange or from a broker for non-exchange traded financial instruments, the fair value of the
  instrument is estimated by the asset managers, using valuation techniques including the use of recent arm's length market transactions, reference to the current fair
  value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow techniques, option pricing models or other valuation techniques that provide a reliable
  estimate of prices obtained in actual market transactions.

- The fair value of the hedged derivatives is calculated as follows:

  (a) The fair value of call options is calculated on a Black-Scholes model.

  (b) The fair value of the return swaps is calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the instruments.

  (c) The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.

1 The inter-segment funding of R339 million reflects a notional allocation of interest earned on the negative reserve backing policyholders' funds of guaranteed investment products and hence is transferred to Discovery Invest.

The segment information is presented on the same basis as reported to the Chief Executive Officers of the reportable segments. The segment total is then adjusted for accounting reclassifications and entries required to produce IFRS compliant results. These adjustments include the following:

2 The contractual arrangement, for business written on Prudential Assurance Company's (PAC's) life insurance license (up to 31 December 2015), is reclassified as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4.

3 The Discovery Unit Trusts (DUT) are consolidated into Discovery's results for IFRS purposes. In the Segment information the DUT column includes the effects of consolidating the unit trusts into Discovery's results, effectively being the income and expenses relating to units held by third parties.

4 Normalised profit adjustments include:
  - The effects of eliminating intercompany linked assets on consolidation.
  - Discovery has not completed the move to the new head office and full occupancy of the building is only expected by March 2018. Duplicate building costs of R25 million have been excluded from normalised profit from operations.
  - The accounting impact of the recognition of a deferred tax asset arising from the Discovery Life Individual Policyholder Fund ('IPF'), has been excluded from normalised profit from operations for segmental purposes.

1 The inter-segment funding of R269 million reflects a notional allocation of interest earned on the negative reserve backing policyholders' funds of guaranteed investment products and hence is transferred to Discovery Invest.

The segment information is presented on the same basis as reported to the Chief Executive Officers (CEO) of the reportable segments. The segment total, as reported to the Chief Executive Officers, is adjusted for accounting reclassifications and entries required to produce IFRS compliant results. These
adjustments include the following:

2 The contractual arrangement, for business written on Prudential Assurance Company's (PAC's) life insurance license (up to 31 December 2015), is reclassified as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4.

3 The Discovery Unit Trusts (DUT) are consolidated into Discovery's results for IFRS purposes. In the Segment information the DUT column includes the effects of consolidating the unit trusts into Discovery's results, effectively being the income and expenses relating to units held by third parties.

4 Rebranding and business acquisitions expenses are excluded from normalised profit from operations, but are included in marketing and administration expenses for IFRS purposes.

1 The new business API for Closed Schemes includes additional lives on existing Closed Schemes. The new business API for New Closed Schemes includes contracted
  new business API and business in the first twelve months of on-boarding. Closed Schemes are those restricted to certain employers and industries.

2 In line with June 2017 reporting, the comparative for Discovery Insure has been restated to only include first year servicing and is net of indirect taxes.

3 Vitality Group new business includes gross recurring and lump sum revenues earned by Vitality Group and specifically excludes fees collected for administrative and
  implementation services.


Calculation of new business annualised premium income

New business API is calculated at 12 times the monthly premium for new recurring premium policies and 10% of the value of new single premium policies. It also
includes both automatic premium increases and servicing increases on existing long-term insurance policies. The amounts exclude indirect taxes and the comparatives
have been restated where necessary.

The new business API in the table above differs from the new business API disclosed in the embedded value largely as a result of:

- The timing of inclusion of policyholders in the calculation of new business API - In the embedded value, new business is included from the earlier of the date that the
  first premium has been received or when the policy is on risk, whereas in the table above, new business is included when the policy has been contractually committed.

- Inclusion of automatic premium increases and servicing increases on existing life policies - These are included in the table above but excluded in the embedded value
  API values disclosed.

Refer to the footnotes to Table 7: Embedded Value of New Business for a more detailed description of the differences in new business disclosures between the
embedded value and the table above.

1 The total of 'All other segments' in the table above does not agree to the normalised profit from operations per the segmental information due
  to the inclusion of the additional 54.99% share of DiscoveryCard after tax profit in Established businesses.


Emerging businesses are those businesses that have achieved sufficient scale to be profitable or profitable in the near future, although not yet significant in cash
generation for the Group and likely to require funds to support new business growth. These businesses are approximately 5 years into their launch. Discovery Insure,
excluding commercial insurance, and Vitality Group have been disclosed as Emerging businesses.

Development and other segments include costs of start-up businesses and expenses incurred to investigate new products and markets. Start-up costs include costs in
relation to the Discovery Bank, the planned UK investment business, a commercial offering in Discovery Insure and an Umbrella Fund offering in Discovery Invest. Head
office costs are also included in this segment.


Significant transactions affecting the current results

Discovery's new head office

Discovery has entered into a 15 year lease agreement for its new head office. The lease commenced November 2017 and Discovery started taking occupancy of the
building at that date, on a phased approach.

IAS 17: Leases, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either a finance lease or an operating lease, at the commencement of the lease term. A lease is classified as a
finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

In terms of the indicators provided in IAS 17.10 and IAS 17.11, Discovery has classified the lease as a finance lease given that the present value of the minimum lease
payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset. This accounting treatment has resulted in the recognition of an asset of R2 549
million, which has been disclosed in 'Property and equipment' and a corresponding lease liability, which has been disclosed in 'Borrowings' in the Statement of financial
position. It should be noted that ownership of the building does not transfer at the end of the lease period but remains that of the landlord. The accounting treatment
does not impact Discovery's covenant compliance.

The treatment under IFRS 16: Leases, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, would result in a similar treatment with the lease capitalised
and as a result the accounting treatment in respect of this particular lease is aligned with future changes.

The building is depreciated over the lease term, using the straight-line method. R28 million depreciation has been recognised in profit or loss for the two months since
beneficial occupancy. Finance charges of R47 million have been recognised in profit or loss in respect of the finance lease liability.

Discovery has not completed the move to the new head office and full occupancy of the building is only expected by March 2018. Various building costs, such as rental,
have therefore been duplicated in the current financial period. For the calculation of normalised headline earnings, duplicate building costs of R25 million have been
added back.

i. United Kingdom borrowings

Discovery previously entered into term facilities totalling GBP 150 million. These borrowings have been used to fund the new business acquisition costs incurred by
VitalityLife, which were previously funded by The Prudential Assurance Company Limited (Prudential) and disclosed as 'Negative Reserve Funding' in the Statement of
financial position.

Discovery repaid GBP 22.5 million of this facility in previous financial periods and a further GBP 20.5 million of this facility on 30 November 2017, of which GBP 13

a. During the current financial period, Discovery registered an unsecured R10 billion Domestic Medium Term Note (DMTN) programme. In preparation of this inaugural
   issuance, Discovery Limited obtained a credit rating from Moody's who assigned a Aa3.za issuer rating on 20 October 2017. In terms of the DMTN programme,
   Discovery issued R1.5 billion JSE Listed Notes in its inaugural issuance on 21 November 2017, with the following profile:

   1 Interest rates on these notes have been fixed at 9.71% per annum, through an interest rate swap.

   2 Interest rates on these notes have been fixed at 10.31% per annum, through an interest rate swap.


b. Discovery Central Services, a subsidiary of the Discovery Group, concluded a 10 year loan facility agreement of R650 million in December 2016, of which R495 million
   was utilised in the previous financial year. The remaining portion of this facility of R155 million was utilised during this financial period and R26 million was repaid in
   terms of the agreement. Interest rates on the facility are fixed at a weighted average rate of 11.44% per annum, with capital and interest repayable in instalments over
   the duration of the loan facility.

Finance charges of R290 million (2016: R96 million) in respect of these South African borrowings have been recognised in profit or loss.

Negative reserve funding

The negative reserve funding liability on Discovery's Statement of financial position represents the acquisition costs that were funded by Prudential on behalf of
VitalityLife. The liability unwinds and is repaid on a matched basis as the cash flows emerge from the assets arising from insurance contracts. In the event that the cash
flows do not emerge as anticipated, VitalityLife would be required to repay these liabilities from other resources.

In terms of the level premium reinsurance treaty that VitalityLife entered into, the reinsurer is required to place a security deposit with Prudential to reduce
counterparty risk. At 31 December 2017, Prudential held GBP 157 million (30 June 2017: GBP 147 million) as a security deposit. The contractual arrangement in respect
of the business written on the Prudential license is accounted for as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4 and as a result, the 'deposit back' held by Prudential has been
disclosed as a reduction of the negative reserve funding liability. The corresponding liability to the reinsurer has been accounted for in 'Trade and other payables'.

The decrease in the negative reserve funding liability in the current financial period, relates to the repayment of funding by VitalityLife as well as an increase in the
amount of deposit back held by Prudential.

Consolidation of Discovery Unit Trusts

The Discovery Unit Trusts are consolidated into Discovery's results for accounting purposes, in both the current and prior financial period. These assets and liabilities
are however attributable to third party unitholders. The following large increases in the Discovery Unit Trusts' Statement of financial position have had a direct impact
on the Group's Statement of financial position:

- Cash and cash equivalents decreased by R582 million.

- Loans and receivables increased by R526 million.

- Trade and other payables increased by R760 million.

- Investments at fair value through profit or loss increased by R2 724 million.

- Investment contracts at fair value through profit or loss increased by R1 887 million.

Other significant items in these results

Taxation

For South African entities that are in a tax paying position, tax has been provided at 28% (2016: 28%) in the financial statements. No deferred tax assets have been
recognised on the assessed losses in Discovery Insure and Vitality Group and no further deferred tax asset has been raised in respect of the VitalityHealth assessed
losses.

In addition, the effective tax rate of the comparative period was abnormally high due to amongst other items, an adjustment to the tax charged by Prudential in respect
of business written on Prudential's life insurance license.

Material transactions with related parties

Discovery Health administers the Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) and provides managed care services for which it charges an administration fee and a
managed healthcare fee respectively. These fees are determined on an annual basis and approved by the trustees of DHMS. The fees totalled R2 662 million for the six
months ended 31 December 2017 (2016: R2 448 million). Discovery offers the members of DHMS access to the Vitality programme.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss have increased by R7 888 million due to market growth and the sale of Discovery Invest products. This includes the
impact of consolidating the Discovery Unit Trusts into the Group's results. The increase in the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss has been presented in
'Net purchase of investments held to back policyholder liabilities' of R3 697 million in the Statement of cash flows.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liability

The deferred tax liability is primarily attributable to the application of the Financial Services Board directive 145. This directive allows for the zeroing on a statutory basis
of the assets arising from insurance contracts. The statutory basis is used when calculating tax payable for Discovery Life, resulting in a timing difference between the
tax base and the accounting base.

A new tax basis for Life companies was promulgated in January 2017. The effective date of the new 'adjusted IFRS' tax valuation basis will align with the implementation
of Solvency Assessment and Management (SAM) and has had no impact on the results of the current period.

Deferred tax asset

As reported in the results for June 2017, recent tax amendments for Life companies introduced a Risk Policy Fund for all new risk business written, effective 1 July 2016.
In terms of the legislation, Discovery Life has elected to move existing risk business to this fund. This election was made in the first quarter of 2017. A portion of the
assessed loss of R16.1 billion (30 June 2017: R16.5 billion) in the Individual Policyholder Fund is now expected to be utilised over time. A value of R702 million (30 June
2017: R562 million), implicit in the valuation of insurance contract liabilities have therefore been recognised as an explicit deferred tax asset in terms of IAS 12: Income
Taxes.

Embedded value statement
for the six months ended 31 December 2017

The embedded value of Discovery consists of the following components:

- the adjusted net worth attributed to the business at the valuation date;

- plus: the present value of expected future shareholder cash flows from the in-force covered business;

- less: the cost of required capital.

The present value of future shareholder cash flows from the in-force covered business is calculated as the value of projected future after-tax shareholder cash flows of
the business in-force at the valuation date, discounted at the risk discount rate.

The required capital are the assets attributed to the covered business above the amount required to back covered business liabilities, whose distribution to
shareholders is restricted as they are allocated to cover regulatory and internal capital requirements.

The value of new business is the present value, at the point of sale, of the projected future after-tax shareholder cash flows of the new business written by Discovery,
discounted at the risk discount rate, less an allowance for the reserving strain, initial expenses and cost of required capital. The value of new business is calculated
using the current reporting date assumptions.

For Life, the shareholder cash flows are based on the release of margins under the Statutory Valuation Method (""SVM"") basis.

The embedded value includes the insurance and administration profits of the covered business in the Discovery Limited group. Covered business includes business
written in South Africa through Discovery Life (""Life""), Discovery Invest (""Invest""), Discovery Health (""Health"") and Discovery Vitality (""Vitality""), and in the United Kingdom
through VitalityLife and VitalityHealth. For Vitality Group, Ping An Health and Discovery Insure, no published value has been placed on the current in-force business as
the businesses have not yet reached suitable scale with predictable experience.

In August 2011, Discovery raised R800 million through the issue of non-cumulative, non-participating, non-convertible preference shares. For embedded value purposes
this capital, net of share issue expenses, has been excluded from the adjusted net worth.

The 31 December 2017 embedded value results and disclosures were not subjected to an external review or audit.

  The excess of available regulatory capital over adjusted net worth reflects the difference between the adjusted net worth and the available regulatory capital. This
  includes the net preference share capital of R779 million which is included as available regulatory capital. At 31 December 2017, this adjustment also includes the
  difference between Vitality Life Limited's Solvency II Pillar 1 Own Funds and its adjusted net worth and adds back the negative reserves eliminated on the Discovery
  funded VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence.

  The required capital at December 2017 for Life is R1 584 million (June 2017: R1 409 million; December 2016: R1 369 million), for Health and Vitality is R778 million
  (June 2017: R797 million; December 2016: R751 million), for VitalityHealth is R1 899 million (June 2017: R1 984 million; December 2016: R1 931 million) and for
  VitalityLife is R3 237 million (June 2017: R2 951 million; December 2016: R2 387 million). For Life, the required capital was set equal to two times the statutory Capital
  Adequacy Requirement. For Health and Vitality, the required capital was set equal to two times the monthly renewal expense and Vitality benefit cost. For
  VitalityHealth, the required capital amount was set equal to 1.35 times (previously 1.4 times) the Solvency II Pillar 1 Solvency Capital Requirement. For the VitalityLife
  business on the Prudential licence, the required capital was set equal to the UK Solvency I long term insurance capital requirement as per the agreement with
  Prudential. For the business sold on the Vitality Life Limited licence, the required capital was set equal to the excess of 1.4 times the Solvency II Pillar 1 Solvency
  Capital Requirement. The Regulatory Required Capital is calculated as the relevant regulatory solvency capital requirement for each insurance business.

1 The mortality and morbidity experience for VitalityHealth arises due to improvements in risk management, sales and retention models, claim payment processes, and
  an increase in Vitality engagement, resulting in lower experience loss ratios over those expected.

2 The premium and fee income experience for Health and Vitality reflects the impact on administration and managed care fees due to the in-period inflation being
  lower than that assumed. For Life, the experience arises largely due to the impact of Vitality distribution shifts compared to expected levels.

3 The tax variance for Life and Invest arises due to a movement in the deferred tax asset which delays the payment of tax.

4 The projection term for Health and Vitality, Group Life and VitalityHealth at 31 December 2017 has not been changed from that used in the 30 June 2017 embedded
  value calculation. Therefore, an experience variance arises because the total term of the in-force covered business is effectively increased by six months.

  excludes premiums in respect of members who join an existing employer where the member has no choice of medical scheme, as well as premiums in respect of new
  business written during the period but only activated after 31 December 2017.

The total Health and Vitality new business annualised premium income written over the period was R3 402 million (June 2017: R6 276 million; December 2016: R3 122
million).

2 Included in the Life and Invest embedded value of new business is R49 million (June 2017: R109 million; December 2016: R93 million) in respect of investment
  management services provided on off balance sheet investment business.

Risk business written prior to the valuation date allows certain Invest business to be written at financially advantageous terms, the impact of which has been
recognised in the value of new business.

3 Life new business is defined as Life policies to which Life became contractually bound during the reporting period, including policies whose first premium is due after
  the valuation date. Invest new business is defined as business where at least one premium has been received and which has not been refunded after receipt. Invest
  new business also includes Discovery Retirement Optimiser policies to which Life and Invest became contractually bound during the reporting period, including policies
  whose first premium is due after the valuation date.

The new business annualised premium income of R1 382 million (June 2017: R2 840 million; December 2016: R1 437 million) (single premium APE: R559 million (June
2017: R1 169 million; December 2016: R592 million)) shown above excludes automatic premium increases and servicing increases in respect of existing business. The
total new business annualised premium income written over the period, including automatic premium increases of R638 million (June 2017: R1 172 million; December
2016: R574 million) and servicing increases of R316 million (June 2017: R659 million; December 2016: R320 million), was R2 337 million (June 2017: R4 671 million;
December 2016: R2 331 million) (single premium APE: R588 million (June 2017: R1 277 million; December 2016: R620 million)). Single premium business is included at
10% of the value of the single premium.

Policy alterations and internal replacement policies, including Discovery Retirement Optimisers added to existing Life Plans, are shown in Table 5 as experience
variances and not included as new business. Term extensions on existing contracts are not included as new business.

4 The annualised profit margin is the value of new business expressed as a percentage of the present value of future premiums.

5 From 30 June 2017, Discovery Retirement Optimiser policies fall under Invest. Therefore, the ""Annualised profit margin excluding Invest business"" at 31 December
  2017 and 30 June 2017 excludes Discovery Retirement Optimiser policies, whereas these policies are included in the 31 December 2016 comparative period. On a
  like-for-like basis to the 31 December 2016 comparative period the ""Annualised profit margin excluding Invest business"" at 31 December 2017 would have been 10.7%
  (June 2017: 9.5%).

1 The United Kingdom Corporation tax rate assumed is 20% in 2017, 19% in 2018 to 2020, and 17% beyond that.

2 VitalityHealth policies are projected for 20 years from the original date of inception.

The Discovery Limited embedded value is calculated based on a risk discount rate using the CAPM approach with specific reference to the Discovery beta coefficient.
The assumed beta is set with reference to the capital structure of the Group and the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time period. The beta is
calculated with reference to the ALSI. The resulting assumed beta will be fixed at this level unless the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time
period departs significantly from this assumption at the financial year end. As beta values reflect the historic performance of share prices relative to the market they
may not allow fully for non-market related and non-financial risk. Investors may want to form their own view on an appropriate allowance for these risks which have
not been modelled explicitly.

Life and Invest mortality, morbidity and lapse and surrender assumptions were derived from internal experience, where available, augmented by reinsurance and
industry information.

The Health and Vitality lapse assumptions were derived from the results of recent experience investigations.

The VitalityHealth assumptions were derived from internal experience, augmented by industry information.

VitalityLife assumptions were derived from internal experience, where available, augmented by reinsurance, industry and Discovery Limited group information.
Renewal expense assumptions were based on the results of the latest expense and budget information.

The initial expenses included in the calculation of the embedded value of new business are the actual costs incurred excluding expenses of an exceptional or
non-recurring nature.

The South African investment return assumption for Life and Invest and Health and Vitality was based on a single interest rate derived from the risk-free zero coupon
government bond yield curve. Other economic assumptions were set relative to this yield. The current and projected tax position of the policyholder funds within the
Life company has been taken into account in determining the net investment return assumption.

The best estimate investment return assumption for VitalityHealth and VitalityLife was based on the single interest rate derived from the risk-free zero coupon sterling
yield curve. The United Kingdom expense inflation assumption was set in line with long-term United Kingdom inflation expectations.

It is assumed that, for the purposes of calculating the cost of required capital, the Life and Invest required capital amount will be backed by surplus assets consisting of
100% equities and the Health, Vitality, VitalityHealth and Vitality Life Limited required capital amounts will be fully backed by cash. The VitalityLife business on the
Prudential licence required capital amount is assumed to earn the same return as the assets backing the VitalityLife policyholder liabilities. Allowance has been made
for tax and investment expenses in the calculation of the cost of required capital. In calculating the capital gains tax liability, it is assumed that the portfolio is realised
every 5 years. The Life and Invest cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the gross of tax equity return and the equity return net of tax and
expenses. The Health, Vitality, VitalityHealth and Vitality Life Limited cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the risk discount rate and the net
of tax cash return. The VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the risk discount rate and the
net of tax asset return assumption.

The embedded value has been calculated in accordance with the Actuarial Society of South Africa's Advisory Practice Note (""APN"") 107: Embedded Value Reporting,
except the recommended disclosure of Free Surplus and Required Capital has been adjusted to take into account the revised capital requirements and resources
arising from Solvency II in the United Kingdom as can be seen in Table 1 note 2.


Sensitivity to the embedded value assumptions

The risk discount rate uses the CAPM approach with specific reference to the Discovery beta coefficient. As beta values reflect the historic performance of share prices relative to the market they may not allow fully for non-market related and non-financial risk. 
Investors may want to form their own view on an appropriate allowance for these risks which have not been modelled explicitly. The sensitivity of the embedded value and the embedded value of new business at 31 December 2017 to changes in the risk discount rate
is included in the tables below.

For each sensitivity illustrated below, all other assumptions have been left unchanged. No allowance has been made for management action such as risk premium increases where future experience is worse than the base assumptions.

TRADING STATEMENT: HALF YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 
 
In accordance with paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Listings Requirements, issuers must publish a trading 
statement as soon as they have a reasonable degree of certainty that earnings per share and / or 
headline earnings per share for the next reporting period will differ by at least 20% from that of the 
previous corresponding period. 

Shareholders are advised that: 
       - Headline earnings per share (undiluted) for the half year ended 31 December 2017 (“current 
         period”) is expected to increase in the range of 33% to 38%, to between 418 cents and 433 cents 
         over the prior half year ended 31 December 2016 (“prior period”) (2016: 314.0 cents); and 
       - Earnings per share (undiluted) is expected to increase in the range of 30% to 35%, to between 409 
         cents and 425 cents (2016: 314.8 cents) over the prior year.  
 
It is practice for the Company to issue a trading statement on “normalised” headline earnings per share, 
which in management’s view best represents the underlying performance of the Group. 
 
Accordingly, shareholders are advised that: 
       - Normalised profit from operations is expected to increase by between 15% and 20% in the current 
         period over the prior period to between R3.9 billion and R4.1 billion (2016: R3.4 billion).  
       - Normalised headline earnings per share (undiluted) is expected to increase in the range of 28% to 
         33%, to between 434 cents and 451 cents over the prior period (2016: 339.0 cents). 
           
The difference in the growth rate between normalised headline earnings per share and normalised profit 
from operations is largely as a result of a lower effective tax rate compared to the prior period.  
 
Discovery’s results for the half year are due to be released on SENS on or about 20 February 2018. 
 
The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported 
on by the Company’s external auditors.

Commentary

Robust Group performance and progression towards Ambition 2018

Discovery produced a robust result for the financial year ended 30 June 2017. The core new business annualised premium income (API) of the Group increased by 16%
to R16 993 million(1), and normalised profit from operations increased by 10% to R7 048 million. In constant currency terms, core new business annualised premium
income grew by 22% to R17 871 million and normalised profit from operations grew 12% to R7 190 million. This demonstrates an acceleration in new business growth
with strong operating profit gains, notwithstanding undertaking significant new initiatives.

The combination of Discovery's unique 'why' and pioneering 'how' - its core purpose of making people healthier, and its Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model - justified
investment over the period in Discovery's stated 2018 Ambition, articulated in three overarching criteria:

1. Financial and social impact, measured against R10 billion in normalised profit from operations, with growth of CPI +10%; return on capital of risk-free +10%; and
   making 10 million people around the world healthier.
2. A unique foundation, comprising a sophisticated data and science capability; an aspirational global Vitality brand; exceptional talent, particularly in terms of critical
   skills; and an entrenched values-based culture.
3. A portfolio of businesses that are
   1) insurgent in their markets;
   2) offer sustainable products that meet complex consumer needs;
   3) generate excellent member engagement;
   4) deliver superior actuarial dynamics; and
   5) offer an exceptional service ecosystem.

The Group saw substantive progress against all three criteria over the period.

In terms of financial impact, the nature of the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model means that businesses are grown organically, guided by an earnings growth
methodology that targets growth in normalised profit from operations of CPI +10% with a substantive investment in new initiatives (set at 10% of earnings). The
emerging businesses that evolve from these new initiatives have a targeted profit growth of CPI +30%; and ultimately develop into established businesses, which are set
a targeted profit growth of CPI +5%.

In terms of our earnings growth target of CPI +10%, earnings grew by 12% in constant currency terms during the period. The established businesses achieved the target
of CPI +5% in constant currency terms, while the emerging businesses tracked above target showing a decrease in operating losses of 61%, although not yet
significantly contributing to earnings. Further, 8% of earnings was invested in new initiatives, which include Discovery's intent to enter banking, the planned UK
investment business, a commercial offering in Discovery Insure, and Discovery Invest's Umbrella Fund offering.

This organic growth engine is supported by a three-tiered capital structure, which allows for regulated entities to be well capitalised, funding of all planned initiatives,
while maintaining an additional liquidity buffer of between R1 billion and R2 billion. This was both true at the end of the financial year and throughout the five-year
planning period. The required return of risk free +10% continues to serve as a guide for the organisation's strategic decision-making and capital allocation. On an
aggregate basis, the Group exceeded this target, both cumulatively to date, and for the expected return on current new business and approved initiatives.

In terms of social impact, the Group is now operating in 16 countries through seven insurers, serving close to 10 million clients, with over 150 000 new members added
each month. Engagement levels over the period were excellent, with most markets experiencing Vitality take-up in excess of 40%. Engaged Vitality members continue to
exhibit better health outcomes, driving and savings behaviour, while the launch of Vitality Active Rewards has seen a dramatic increase in physical activity levels
globally.

The period witnessed several important investments in developing Discovery's unique foundation.

In terms of science and data, the Global Vitality Network - Discovery's central insurance platform to advance the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model - developed new
IP in product, programme, and partnership constructs that can be deployed across Discovery's markets. For example, work is underway with Columbia University to
promote healthy longevity at older ages by developing age-specific preventive recommendations. Further, the Global Vitality Network has invested in a centralised data
capability that houses the richest set of mortality, morbidity, and engagement data globally (40 million life years of behaviour-linked data), which is used to optimise
value-creation in pricing and product design.

With reference to brand consolidation, work was done to advance Discovery's leadership to own the category of Shared-Value Insurance, with the Shared Value
Initiative and FSG (a leading social change consulting firm) releasing a white paper in the period that highlighted Discovery and its insurance partners as global pioneers
of Shared-Value Insurance.

Discovery also invested significantly in strengthening recruitment processes and leadership development to meet its criteria of attracting and retaining the best people
within a values-based culture. Over the period, an average of 1 500 candidates were screened per open position. Work also continued to achieve an inclusive and
transformed workforce, prioritising the recruitment, development and retention of black South Africans in senior positions.
Discovery's portfolio of businesses all achieved at least four out of the five criteria. Over the period, dedicated work was done to address the gaps in requirements,
including:

1. in the SA primary market - further integration and expansion of the model to cater for different client segments across the income spectrum
2. in the UK primary market - focus on business quality with targeted growth
3. in Vitality Group - expansion of the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model 
4. in Ping An Health - building the leading specialist health insurance company in China.

(1) Core new business API excludes Discovery Health's take-on of new closed schemes and gross revenue in respect of Vitality Group


Business-specific performance: South Africa

Discovery Health

Both Discovery Health and Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) delivered excellent results. During the financial year, Discovery Health's normalised operating
profit increased by 11% to R2 505 million; new business annualised premium income increased by 18% to R6 109 million (excluding take-on of new closed schemes);
and lives under management reached 3.39 million. In addition, DHMS announced a highly competitive contribution increase of 7.9%, and ended the 2016 calendar year
with a total surplus in excess of R1.3 billion.

The period witnessed continued success in growing the closed scheme client base. Discovery Health was awarded contracts to administer the SAB, Glencore and
Netcare Medical Aid Schemes, bringing its restricted scheme client base to 18 with over 635 000 lives under management.

Furthermore, notwithstanding significant claims-cost pressures, Discovery Health's substantial investment in risk management systems ensured that DHMS ended the
calendar year with a substantial total surplus, taking capital reserves to 26.3% of gross contributions, well above the statutory level of 25%. This excellent performance
has continued into 2017, and DHMS is now in the strongest financial position in its history, with membership of 2.76 million lives at year-end.

Discovery Health increased its investment in the healthcare system and digital assets over the period. This included further expansion in the HomeCare, pharmacy
distribution and wellness operations; and enhanced value-based contracting with health professionals, and with hospital centres of excellence. Discovery Health's
investment in technology and expertise to address medical scheme fraud led to recoveries of over R405 million for its client medical schemes during the 2016 calendar
year.

The business also made significant new investments in big data analytics and artificial intelligence capabilities. This included the launch of DrConnect, a health
information and virtual consultation app, as well as enhancements to the functionality and coverage of Discovery HealthID - the country's leading electronic health
record system, in regular use by over 1.37 million members.

Several innovative changes were developed over the year for the 2018 DHMS and Discovery Health launch. This included DHMS's benefit changes to enhance cover for
young families; and Discovery Health's significant enhancements to its Gap Cover and Primary Care products, as well as Discovery for Corporates - a fully integrated
employee assistance offering for corporate clients.

Discovery Health maintains its strong support for the objectives of the proposed National Health Insurance (NHI), and continues to work closely with the National
Department of Health and other stakeholders to ensure optimal outcomes of the NHI policy process. Discovery Health also continues to participate actively in the
processes of the Health Market Inquiry of the Competition Commission, which is expected to report its findings by the end of 2017.

Discovery Life

Discovery Life performed strongly over the period. New business annualised premium income increased by 17% to R2 175 million, and earnings increased by 10% to R3
588 million, despite the impact of higher-than-expected claims. Market share increased to 29.7%(2) in the retail affluent protection segment, while the value of new
business grew by 17%.

From a new business annualised premium income perspective, Group Risk increased by 96%, facilitated by the provision of risk cover to a large employer group; and
Individual Life new business increased by 12% to R1 970 million. While claims were above expectation over the period, the long-term historic claims experience
remained below embedded value expectation. Lapses were at 83% of expectation on a policy count basis, emphasising the value of integration; and PayBack of R986
million was paid to policyholders - demonstrating the impact of the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model.

Work done over the period for Discovery Life's 2018 launch saw the introduction of a suite of products that address needs at each stage of clients' lives, aimed at
driving further market share and new business. This included the Smart Life Plan, tailored for young professionals; the Global Education Protector, for young families;
and the Purple Life Plan, aimed at meeting the protection needs of high net-worth clients.

Discovery Invest

Discovery Invest saw a solid performance during the period. Operating profit grew 12% to R744 million and assets under administration grew by 14% to R69.5 billion,
with 76% of linked funds in Discovery Funds. New business growth was 3%, in a challenging market. Discovery Balanced Fund was in the top six retail net flow takers in
each quarter over the past two years and significant inroads were made in the retirement annuity, preservation, and income space.

Discovery Invest's application of the Shared-Value Insurance model has resulted in clients starting to save on average two years earlier for retirement, and withdrawing
2% less from their living annuity in retirement. This is projected to result in them having, on average, a 50% greater fund value 10 years into retirement(3). Since
inception, the business has given clients in excess of R5.7 billion in Shared-Value benefits. It also reduced lapse rates to below expectation through a combination of the
model and a dedicated conservation strategy.

Since the launch of Shared-Value retirement savings and linked annuities products in September 2015, Discovery Invest's share of flows in the Linked Investment
Service Provider industry has increased from 4.4% (in Q3 2015) to 20.7% (in Q2 2017) for retirement savings, and from 2.3% (in Q3 2015) to 6.8% (in Q2 2017) for linked
annuities. Following the success of this focused retirement strategy, the business has extended the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model to discretionary investment
vehicles. Discovery Invest also launched a hedge fund, share portfolio porting capabilities, as well as a more accessible offering for young professionals.

Discovery Insure

Discovery Insure's performance exceeded expectation. The business achieved a cumulative profit in the second half of the financial year and reduced its combined ratio
by 8.4%. Gross written premium increased by 32% to R2.1 billion, driven by new business annualised premium income growth of 19%, to R895 million. This has brought
the inforce annualised premium to just under R3 billion, reflecting the rapid scaling of the business, and support for mainstream adoption of telematics insurance.

The Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model has continued to prove itself through better upfront selection, ongoing risk improvement through incentives, and the
retention of good risk, which has improved the quality of the book over time.

During the period, the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model was extended to the car rental industry through a partnership with Avis (Avis SafeDrive), giving its clients
access to Discovery Insure's sensor and app technology, and rewards for good driving. This solution aims to curb the high accident rate in the car rental industry, which
is twice as high as private vehicles(4).

In addition, Discovery Insure's 2018 launch focused on enhancing rewards for all drivers, and particularly the safest drivers. This included an enhanced rewards and
partner platform for Vitality Active Rewards and the launch of a new Diamond status. The launch also focused on particular market segments, introducing a Young
Adult benefit to reduce risks for drivers under 30, and replacing the current Executive Plan with the Purple Plan for high net-worth clients.

Discovery Card

The Discovery Card business exceeded expectation over the period, with the FNB Card JV profits growing by 16% to R355 million.

Net interest income increased by 9.7%, and non-interest revenue grew by 10%. Discovery's credit card base is less sensitive to current negative market conditions due
to a substantially better risk profile. The credit loss rate to advances was 1.7%, compared to the market average of 6% for tier 1 credit providers.

In the past year turnover spend on Discovery Card was up 6.2% versus that of the market, which was up 1.7%. Debt balances (advances) were up 5.4%, compared with 2.5% in
the market.

Intent to enter banking

On 25 October 2016, Discovery received authorisation from the Registrar of Banks to establish a banking presence in South Africa, granted in terms of Section 13(1) of
the Banks Act, Act No. 94 of 1990 (""the Banks Act""), subject to certain conditions.

Pursuant to this authorisation, Discovery has 12 months to fulfil the conditions set by the Registrar and to make application for final approval in terms of Section 16 of
the Banks Act. The granting of a banking licence pursuant to Section 17 of the Banks Act, and the timing of such grant is subject to the approval and discretion of the
Registrar of Banks.

Significant progress has been made in developing the system infrastructure, operating processes, regulatory engagement and the customer value proposition, with a
number of key milestones having already been reached.

Subject to the above, Discovery anticipates launching its proposed banking offering during 2018.

Business-specific performance: United Kingdom

Discovery's UK business delivered a robust performance despite the challenging economic landscape. For the combined business, new business increased by 1% to
£118 million(5), insured lives approached one million, and operating profit grew by 10% to £44.4 million(6).

The Vitality product enhancements launched at the end of the 2016 calendar year resonated strongly with the market, and precipitated significant behaviour change in the areas of
physical activity and nutrition. The HealthyFood benefit with Ocado, which provides a discount of up to 25% on healthy food items, resulted in a 19% increase of healthy
food in members' baskets during the first six months of the benefit. Similarly, the inclusion of Apple Watch in the Vitality Active Rewards benefit has driven a 42%
increase in the number of physical activity points earned by members taking up the Apple Watch benefit in the six months from December 2016 to June 2017. Vitality
UK plans to launch a suite of investment products in 2018, subject to regulatory approval.

VitalityHealth

VitalityHealth's new business, loss ratio, Vitality engagement, and operating profit all recorded best-ever performance levels during the financial year. Operating profit
grew by 89%, at £16.4 million(7); and new business grew by 4% to £56.2 million(8), with continued strong growth in the more profitable individual market (+9%) and
direct channels (+13%).

Individual new business comprised 50% of overall new business, demonstrating the powerful selection effect of the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model in this
market. From a claims perspective, the combined effect of Vitality on member selection, retention and risk; the purchasing power achieved through the Healthcare
Purchasing Alliance; and a re-engineering of the claims management process, contributed to the excellent claims performance over the period.

The period was further characterised by the strong delivery of the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model. From a member perspective, the value of Vitality rewards and
healthy activity discounts increased to £62.7 million from £48.6 million, with 46% of engaged individual members saving more than half their premium.

VitalityLife

The UK's decision to leave the European Union created volatility at the beginning of the financial year, with this environment of uncertainty, and low long-term interest
rates, leading to a decrease of 1% in new business to £61.8 million(9) and a decrease of 11% in normalised operating profit to £28.1 million(10). The prior period margin
releases, driven by the fall in interest rates, led to a reduction of c.25% in the current period earnings. Consequently, over the second half of the financial year,
VitalityLife re-configured its products and strategy to right-size the business for this new operating environment. The new structure is robust in the current environment
with upside should interest rates increase, which is the expectation considering the current negative yield environment.

The fundamentals of the VitalityLife business remained strong over the period, with claims ratios significantly below expectation. The steady and continued adoption of
the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model (Vitality-linked products comprise c.63% of new business), has been a key driver of the increasing value of new business
margin, which improved to 36%.

VitalityLife's continued product innovation saw a drive towards more capital-efficient products with a focus on business mix. Over the period, VitalityLife further
embedded wellness into its product range, with the most notable addition being the Wellness Optimiser that rewards clients for improving their health status.

VitalityLife also launched Vitality Nurse, a proprietary range of medical screening and nursing services aimed at significantly improving the underwriting process. Vitality
Nurse offers screening by a clinically qualified nurse in clients' homes in as little as two hours from the time of submission of the application.

Business-specific performance: Vitality Group

Over the period, Vitality Group launched Vitality Shared-Value Insurance in six new markets worldwide, bringing the total number of countries with a Vitality Shared-
Value Insurance offering to 16, including the primary markets in South Africa and the United Kingdom. Vitality membership grew 20% to 1.25 million with Vitality-
integrated insurance in-force premiums increasing by 226% to R2.7 billion year-on-year. Vitality Group's operating result improved by 39% (excluding Ping An Health),
with the expectation that the business will reach profitability within the next financial year.

Vitality Group's strategy remained focused on expanding the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model to more insurers globally, integrating with more products from
existing partners, and maximising penetration and engagement. To this end, Vitality Group partnered with Hannover Re to market Vitality Active, a mobile-only version
of Vitality Shared-Value Insurance focused primarily on Vitality Active Rewards. Vitality Active is both faster and more economical to launch than traditional Vitality,
making it attractive to smaller life and health insurance markets. So far, three insurers have signed Letters of Intent.

In addition, Vitality Shared-Value Insurance expanded to Canada, Germany, Austria and France, with standalone Vitality Active Rewards going live in Hong Kong,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.

In terms of systems assets, Vitality Group has invested in the development of Vitality One - a cost-effective and configurable technology chassis for rolling out Vitality
Shared-Value Insurance to new and existing health and life insurance markets, allowing for more rapid deployment of innovation globally.

The period also saw market recognition of partner insurers: AIA Australia won the Customer Innovation award for Vitality at the Financial Services Life Insurance
Awards, and AIA Hong Kong received five gold awards at Marketing Magazine's Mob-Ex Awards 2017 for the Active Rewards campaign. The French insurance magazine
L'Argus de l'Assurance presented Generali Vitality the Innovation of the Year Award for the Corporate Life Business segment.

John Hancock Vitality and Manulife Vitality

The John Hancock and Manulife partnerships continued to gain traction in North America. John Hancock Vitality-linked policies grew significantly on both a policy count
and premium basis, due to more US States approving the Vitality-integrated insurance product, strengthening the term and unit-linked offerings, increased broker
adoption resulting from immersive Vitality training programmes, and resonance of the Apple Watch benefit.
Manulife anticipates accelerated growth and penetration in Canada with a broader set of insurance products linked with Vitality, and the launch of Active Rewards with
Apple Watch later this year.

AIA Vitality

During the period, AIA Vitality, the most mature Vitality Group partner market, launched stand-alone Active Rewards campaigns to market Vitality and create up-sell
opportunities in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.

myOwn, a new Australian health insurer and joint venture between Discovery, AIA Australia, and GMHBA Ltd, launched in July 2017. myOwn offers health insurance
integrated with AIA Vitality through various channels, including direct and online aggregators; and will soon also integrate with AIA Life to create a compelling product
offering combining both health and life insurance with Vitality.

Generali Vitality

Generali Vitality's launch in Germany received excellent media and market responses and has resulted in high sales volumes, large policy premium sizes and good
client engagement. The product is distributed via numerous channels including the tied agency channel of Generali Lebensversicherung, independent brokers Dialog
Lebensversicherung and CosmosDirekt online. Deutsche Vermogensberatung, Germany's largest independent financial advisor network, will launch Vitality in January
2018.

Generali France's corporate Vitality Shared-Value Insurance offering has seen a significant number of corporates activating Vitality; with exciting prospects for the
Generali Austria Vitality offering, which commences sales from 1 October 2017.

Business-specific performance: Ping An Health

Ping An Health performed excellently over the period, with membership growing by 428% to 3.7 million. Its annualised new business net premium increased 103% to
RMB 1.6 billion year-on-year, driven largely by the success of the Internet product, with operating profit in Rand terms increasing by 66%.

As part of Ping An Health's strategy to reach more cities in China, a new branch has opened in the Chengdu region which has a population of more than 14 million.
Further provincial level branches and several smaller branches are planned to open in 2018.

Growth projections for Ping An Health's revenue remain high, largely as a result of Ping An Group's broad distribution footprint. After receiving an ""A-"" credit rating
from AM Best Credit Rating Company, Ping An Health qualified for a reinsurance licence from the Chinese Insurance Regulatory Commission in August 2017. This is a
significant step in Ping An Health's development plan and its continuing growth.

Vitality continues to gain traction throughout Ping An. Vitality Active Rewards with Ping An Life has reached 2.4 million members in only 12 months, with high member
engagement levels. In addition, Ping An Health's Vitality programme has been upgraded and is live on three products.

Prospects for growth

A sophisticated capital management structure supports the organic growth methodology to ensure Discovery's financial strength, sufficient financial flexibility through
cash generation, and production of above-target returns. Discovery foresees continued strong performance from existing businesses going forward; and spend on new
initiatives to reduce over time, absent of the intent to enter banking. The combination of the above positions Discovery for continued growth in the future.

Fair value hierarchy of financial instruments
The Group's financial instruments measured at fair value have been disclosed using a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy has three levels that reflect the significance of
the inputs used in measuring fair value. These are as follows:

Level 1 includes financial instruments that are measured using unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for identical financial instruments. Quoted prices are
readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly
occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.

Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data. Instruments in this category are valued using:
(a) quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which are not considered to be active or
(b) valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.

Level 3 includes financial instruments that are valued using valuation techniques that incorporate information other than observable market data and where at least
one input (which could have a significant effect on instruments' valuation) cannot be based on observable market data.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments in level 2
- Discovery has invested in equity linked notes offered by international banks in order to back certain unit-linked contract liabilities. The calculation of the daily value
  of the equity linked investments is made by the provider of the note. Discovery has procedures in place to ensure that these prices are correct. Aside from the daily
  reasonableness checks versus similar funds and movement since the prior day's price, the fund values are calculated with reference to a specific formula or index,
  disclosed to the policyholders, which is recalculated by Discovery in order to check if the price provided by the provider is correct.

- If a quoted market price is not available on a recognised stock exchange or from a broker for non-exchange traded financial instruments, the fair value of the
  instrument is estimated by the asset managers, using valuation techniques including the use of recent arm's length market transactions, reference to the current fair
  value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow techniques, option pricing models or other valuation techniques that provide a
  reliable estimate of prices obtained in actual market transactions.

- The fair value of the hedged derivatives is calculated by the issuers of those instruments, as follows:
  (a) The fair value of call options is calculated on a Black-Scholes model.
  (b) The fair value of the return swaps is calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the instruments.
  (c) The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.

(1) The inter-segment funding of R573 million reflects a notional allocation of interest earned on the negative reserve backing policyholders' funds of guaranteed investment products and hence is transferred to Discovery Invest.

The segment information is presented on the same basis as reported to the Chief Executive Officers of the reportable segments. The segment total is then adjusted for accounting reclassifications and entries required to produce IFRS compliant
results. These adjustments include the following:

(2) The VitalityLife results, for business written on the Prudential Assurance Company license, are reclassified to account for the contractual arrangement as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4.
(3) The Discovery Unit Trusts (DUT) are consolidated into Discovery's results for IFRS purposes. In the Segment information the DUT column includes the effects of consolidating the unit trusts into Discovery's results, effectively being the income and
    expenses relating to units held by third parties.
(4) Normalised profit adjustments:
    Investment income on assets backing policyholder liabilities is included as part of the normalised profit from operations in the segmental disclosure, but is included together with shareholder investment income for IFRS purposes. Rebranding
    and business acquisitions expenses are excluded from normalised profit from operations, but are included in marketing and administration expenses for IFRS purposes.

    The accounting impact of the recognition of a deferred tax asset arising from the Discovery Life Individual Policyholder Fund ('IPF'), has been excluded from normalised profit from operations for segmental purposes.

(1) The inter-segment funding of R452 million reflects a notional allocation of interest earned on the negative reserve backing policyholders' funds of guaranteed investment products and hence is transferred to Discovery Invest.

The segment information is presented on the same basis as reported to the Chief Executive Officers (CEO) of the reportable segments. At each reporting date, Discovery must review whether the segments being disclosed still comply with IFRS8 -
Segment reporting. Based on this review, the following changes were required:

(2) Since the beginning of the current financial year, the performance of the Discovery Retirement Optimiser (DRO) product is reported to the CEO of Discovery Invest. DRO was previously reported as part of the SA Life segment. The comparatives
    have been restated to include the DRO product in the SA Invest segment, in line with the current year disclosure.

The segment total, as reported to the CEO, is adjusted for accounting reclassifications and entries required to produce IFRS compliant results. These adjustments include the following:

(3) The VitalityLife results, for business written on the Prudential Assurance Company license, are reclassified to account for the contractual arrangement as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4.
(4) The Discovery Unit Trusts (DUT) are consolidated into Discovery's results for IFRS purposes. In the Segment information the DUT column includes the effects of consolidating the unit trusts into Discovery's results, effectively being the income and
    expenses relating to units held by third parties.
(5) Investment income on assets backing policyholder liabilities is included as part of the normalised profit from operations in the segmental disclosure, but is included together with shareholder investment income for IFRS purposes. Rebranding
    and business acquisitions expenses are excluded from normalised profit from operations, but are included in marketing and administration expenses for IFRS purposes.

(2) The comparatives have been restated to include the Discovery Retirement Optimiser (DRO) in the Discovery Invest new business API
    which was previously included in the Discovery Life new business API.
(3) The comparative for Discovery Insure has been restated to only include first year servicing, and is net of indirect taxes.
(4) Vitality Group new business includes gross recurring and lump sum revenues earned by Vitality Group and specifically excludes fees
    collected for administrative and implementation services.

In the past two years, Discovery Health has brought on a number of new Closed Schemes, of varying sizes, resulting in large fluctuations in the new business annualised
premium income in the year of acquisition. By excluding the new business annualised premium income for these new schemes, hence reducing the volatility caused,
the new business annualised premium income for Discovery increased 16% for the year ended 30 June 2017, when compared to the same period in the prior year.

Calculation of new business annualised premium income (API)

New business API is calculated at 12 times the monthly premium for new recurring premium policies and 10% of the value of new single premium policies. It also
includes both automatic premium increases and servicing increases on existing policies. The amounts exclude indirect taxes and the comparatives have been restated
where necessary.

The new business API in the table above differs from the new business API disclosed in the embedded value largely as a result of:
- The timing of inclusion of policyholders in the calculation of new business API - In the embedded value, new business is included from the earlier of the date that the
  first premium has been received or when the policy is on risk, whereas in the table above, new business is included when the policy has been contractually
  committed.
- Inclusion of automatic premium increases and servicing increases on existing life policies - These are included in the table above but excluded in the embedded
  value API values disclosed.

For Ping An Health, the embedded value definition of new business is used in the table above.
Refer to the footnotes to Table 7: Embedded Value of New Business for a more detailed description of the differences in new business disclosures between the
embedded value and the table above.

Gross inflows under management

Gross inflows under management measures the total funds collected by Discovery. Gross inflows under management increased 10% for the year ended 30 June 2017
when compared to the same period in the prior year.

Emerging businesses are those businesses that have achieved sufficient scale to be profitable or profitable in the near future, although not yet significant in cash
generation for the Group and likely to require funds to support new business growth. These businesses are approximately 5 years into their launch. Discovery Insure,
excluding commercial insurance, and Vitality Group have been disclosed as Emerging businesses.
Development and other segments include costs of start-up businesses and expenses incurred to investigate new products and markets. Start-up costs include costs in
relation to the bank, the planned UK investment business, a commercial offering in Discovery Insure, and an Umbrella Fund offering in Discovery Invest. Head office
costs are also included in this segment.

Significant transactions affecting the current results

Increase in borrowings

United Kingdom borrowings

During the past two financial years, Discovery entered into term facilities totalling GBP 150 million, of which GBP 120 million was utilised by the end of June 2016. In the
current financial year, Discovery utilised the remaining GBP 30 million of its facilities. These borrowings have been used to fund the new business acquisition costs
incurred by VitalityLife. These costs were previously funded by The Prudential Assurance Company Limited (Prudential) and disclosed as Negative Reserve Funding in
the Statement of financial position.

Discovery repaid GBP 7.5 million of this facility on 30 November 2016 and 31 May 2017 respectively, as per the agreed terms (2016: GBP 7.5 million). The balance owing
at 30 June 2017 amounts to GBP 127.5 million (R2 174 million) (2016: GBP 112.5 million (R2 226 million)).

Interest rates on these facilities are floating, linked to 3 month LIBOR, payable quarterly in arrears. Finance charges of R50 million (2016: R60 million) in respect of these
borrowings have been recognised in profit or loss.

South African borrowings

During the current financial year, Discovery utilised an additional R2 billion of its bank syndicated loan programme entered into in June 2016. The amount outstanding
under this programme totals R5 billion (2016: R3 billion).

The additional 5 year term facility of R2 billion, has the following profile:

                                                                                              Amount

* Interest is payable quarterly in arrears.

- Furthermore, Discovery Central Services, a subsidiary of the Discovery Group, concluded a 10 year loan facility agreement of R650 million, of which R495 million
  was utilised in the current financial year. Interest rates on the utilised amount is fixed at a weighted average rate of 11.44% per annum, with capital and interest
  repayable in instalments over the duration of the loan facility.
- On 30 June 2017, R500 million was raised in the form of unsecured Investment Notes with a 5 year term, on which interest accrues at a floating margin linked to
  3 month JIBAR. Interest and capital are repayable on 30 June 2022.
- The Group entered into various finance leases during the current financial year in the ordinary course of business, totalling a net increase of R209 million.

Finance charges of R368 million (2016: R155 million) in respect of these South African borrowings have been recognised in profit or loss.

Negative reserve funding

The negative reserve funding liability on Discovery's Statement of financial position represents the acquisition costs that were funded by Prudential on behalf of
VitalityLife. The liability unwinds and is repaid on a matched basis as the cash flows emerge from the assets arising from insurance contracts. In the event that the cash
flows do not emerge as anticipated, VitalityLife would be required to repay these liabilities from other resources.

In terms of the level premium reinsurance treaty that VitalityLife entered into, the reinsurer is required to place a security deposit with Prudential to reduce
counterparty risk. At 30 June 2017, Prudential held GBP 147 million (2016: GBP 85 million) as a security deposit. The contractual arrangement in respect of the business
written on the Prudential license is accounted for as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4 and as a result, the 'deposit back' held by Prudential has been disclosed as a
reduction of the negative reserve funding liability. The corresponding liability to the reinsurer has been accounted for in Trade and other payables.

The decrease in the negative reserve funding liability in the current financial year, relates to the repayment of funding by VitalityLife as well as an increase in the
amount of deposit back held by Prudential.

Expiry of BEE transaction

In September 2005, Discovery concluded a BEE transaction pursuant to which 38 725 909 shares were issued to a consortium of BEE parties. 1 106 455 of these shares
were issued to the Maphai SPV being one of the BEE consortium members for an initial period of 11 years (initial period). The shares were issued at R0.001 each, with a
subscription consideration of R1.72 per share.

The difference between the market value of the ordinary shares issued to the BEE parties and the subscription consideration, represented an outstanding funded
amount provided by Discovery shareholders (funded amount). As a result, 1 017 939 of the shares issued to the Maphai SPV were treated as treasury shares.
The BEE parties committed to utilise any dividend or capital distributions made by Discovery to acquire additional Discovery shares in the market within three months
of the date of any distributions. These additional shares were also treated as treasury shares.

At the end of the initial period,
- Discovery had the right to repurchase such number of ordinary shares at R0.001 per share that would provide Discovery with a notional return of the funded amount.
- In order for the Maphai SPV to retain the full number of Discovery shares originally issued to them, the Maphai SPV then had the right to simultaneously acquire from
  Discovery, at the then thirty-day volume-weighted average price per Discovery share, the same number of shares repurchased by Discovery.

The initial period expired in December 2016 and resulted in the following transactions:
- Discovery repurchased 582 954 Discovery shares held by the Maphai SPV at a price of R0.001 per Discovery share.
- The Maphai SPV chose not to exercise their right to acquire the shares repurchased by Discovery. These shares have been cancelled from issue.

As a result of this transaction, treasury shares have decreased by 1 200 554 shares, representing shares funded through this transaction as well additional shares
purchased by the Maphai SPV utilising dividend distributions. The delivery of treasury shares purchased by the Maphai SPV using dividend distributions received in the
past, resulted in an increase in Share Premium of R11 million.

All amounts funded in terms of the September 2005 BEE transaction have now been repaid.

Consolidation of Discovery Unit Trusts

The Discovery Unit Trusts are consolidated into Discovery's results in both the current and prior financial year. The following large increases in the Discovery Unit
Trusts' Statement of financial position have had a direct impact on the Group's Statement of financial position:
- Cash and cash equivalents decreased by R667 million.
- Loans and receivables decreased by R250 million.
- Trade and other payables decreased by R1 476 million.
- Investments at fair value through profit or loss increased by R4 099 million.
- Investment contracts at fair value through profit or loss increased by R1 412 million.

Other significant items in these results

Increase in the DiscoveryCard profit share arrangement in the prior period

In December 2015, Discovery increased its economic interest in the DiscoveryCard (a ""Discovery"" branded FNB credit card), by subscribing for R1.4 billion redeemable
preference shares in the share capital of FirstRand Bank Limited (FRB). This entitled Discovery to receive an additional 54.99% of the profits generated by the
DiscoveryCard effective from 1 July 2015.

The contractual rights under the preference shares were only finalised in April 2016 and as such, any profits earned prior to that, being R86 million, represented an
adjustment to the purchase price rather than income received. In order to reflect the economic effect of the transaction, this was added to Normalised headline
earnings for the year ended 30 June 2016.

In terms of IAS 38: Intangible Assets, the preference shares have been disclosed as an intangible asset in the Statement of financial position as the substance of the
arrangement is a right to receive additional 54.99% of the profits generated by the DiscoveryCard. This intangible asset is amortised through profit or loss as and when
profits are expected to emerge. R84 million (2016: R26 million) amortisation has been recognised for the current financial year. This has been added back in the
calculation of Normalised headline earnings.

Recapture of reinsurance

VitalityHealth makes use of financial reinsurance as a financing tool for new business acquisition costs. The receipt from the reinsurer is recognised in profit or loss
upfront in the year received. Thereafter, the repayment to the reinsurer and the cost of funding are expensed through profit or loss.

During the current financial year, VitalityHealth converted their Cash financial reinsurance to Cashless financial reinsurance to minimise the cost of funding. This was
done by recapturing GBP 49.6 million of reinsurance obligations and replacing this with new cashless reinsurance treaties. The impact on the Income statement is an
expense of R858 million in 'Recapture of reinsurance' which is offset by new financing recognised in 'Recovery of expenses from reinsurers'.
Material transactions with related parties

Discovery Health administers the Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) and provides managed care services for which it charges an administration fee and a
managed healthcare fee respectively. These fees are determined on an annual basis and approved by the trustees of DHMS. The fees totalled R5 089 million for the
year ended 30 June 2017 (2016: R4 711 million). Discovery offers the members of DHMS access to the Vitality programme.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss have increased by R7.8 billion due to the sale of Discovery Invest products. This includes the impact of consolidating
the Discovery Unit Trusts into the Group's results. The increase in the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss has been presented in 'Net purchase of
investments held to back policyholder liabilities' of R7 084 million in the Statement of cash flows.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax liability

The deferred tax liability is primarily attributable to the application of the Financial Services Board directive 145. This directive allows for the zeroing on a statutory basis
of the assets arising from insurance contracts. The statutory basis is used when calculating tax payable for Discovery Life, resulting in a timing difference between the
tax base and the accounting base.

A new tax basis for Life companies was promulgated in January 2017. The effective date of the new 'adjusted IFRS' tax valuation basis will align with the implementation
of Solvency Assessment and Management (SAM) and has had no impact on the current year's results.

Deferred tax asset

Recent tax amendments for Life companies introduced a Risk Policy Fund for all new risk business written, effective 1 July 2016. In terms of the legislation, Discovery
Life has elected to move existing risk business to this fund. A portion of the assessed loss of R16.5 billion in the Individual Policyholder Fund is now expected to be
utilised over time. A value of R562 million, implicit in the valuation of insurance contract liabilities have therefore been recognised as an explicit deferred tax asset in
terms of IAS 12: Income Taxes.

The impact of this recognition on the Statement of financial position is an increase in the deferred tax asset of R562 million and a corresponding increase in Liabilities
arising from insurance contracts. The impact on the Income statement is an increase in Transfer from liabilities under insurance contracts of R562 million and a
corresponding decrease in Income tax expense.

Taxation

For South African entities that are in a tax paying position, tax has been provided at 28% (2016: 28%) in the financial statements. No deferred tax assets have been
recognised on the assessed losses in Discovery Insure and Vitality Group and no further deferred tax asset has been raised in respect of the VitalityHealth assessed
losses.

covered 2.15 times (2016: 2.95 times). Both VitalityHealth and Discovery Insure are adequately capitalised at 145% (2016: 140%) and 221% (2016: 265%) respectively.

Accounting policies

The Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards including IAS 34, as well as the South African
Companies Act 71 of 2008. The accounting policies adopted are consistent with the accounting policies applied in the prior Annual Financial Statements.

Audit

The consolidated financial statements are considered preliminary based on the JSE Listings Requirements and are summarised from a complete set of the Group
financial statements.

This summarised report is extracted from audited information, but is not itself audited. The Annual Financial Statements were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc.,
who expressed an unmodified opinion thereon. The audited Annual Financial Statements and Auditor's Report thereon are available for inspection at the Company's
registered office.

Any forecast financial information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the Company's external auditors.

The directors of Discovery take full responsibility for the preparation of this report and that the financial information has been correctly extracted from the underlying
Annual Financial Statements.

Embedded value statement
for the year ended 30 June 2017

The embedded value of Discovery consists of the following components:
- the adjusted net worth attributed to the business at the valuation date;
- plus: the present value of expected future shareholder cash flows from the in-force covered business;
- less: the cost of required capital.

The present value of future shareholder cash flows from the in-force covered business is calculated as the value of projected future after-tax shareholder cash flows of
the business in-force at the valuation date, discounted at the risk discount rate.

The required capital are the assets attributed to the covered business above the amount required to back covered business liabilities, whose distribution to
shareholders is restricted as they are allocated to cover regulatory and internal capital requirements.

The value of new business is the present value, at the point of sale, of the projected future after-tax shareholder cash flows of the new business written by Discovery,
discounted at the risk discount rate, less an allowance for the reserving strain, initial expenses and cost of required capital. The value of new business is calculated
using the current reporting date assumptions.

For Life, the shareholder cash flows are based on the release of margins under the Statutory Valuation Method (""SVM"") basis.

The embedded value includes the insurance and administration profits of the covered business in the Discovery Limited group. Covered business includes business
written in South Africa through Discovery Life (""Life""), Discovery Invest (""Invest""), Discovery Health (""Health"") and Discovery Vitality (""Vitality""), and in the United Kingdom
through VitalityLife and VitalityHealth. For Vitality Group, Ping An Health and Discovery Insure, no published value has been placed on the current in-force business as
the businesses have not yet reached suitable scale with predictable experience.

In August 2011, Discovery raised R800 million through the issue of non-cumulative, non-participating, non-convertible preference shares. For embedded value purposes
this capital, net of share issue expenses, has been excluded from the adjusted net worth.

In January 2016, the European insurance regulation Solvency II came into effect and Vitality Life Limited was granted a life insurance licence in the United Kingdom on
which it commenced writing new business. These two changes required that the embedded value methodology for VitalityLife be reviewed. The key methodology
change was the zeroisation of the negative reserves emerging under insurance contracts in Vitality Life Limited and Discovery funded VitalityLife business on the
Prudential licence. This effectively moves the negative reserve from net worth to the value of in-force.

The 30 June 2017 embedded value results and disclosures were subjected to an external review.

    The excess of available regulatory capital over adjusted net worth reflects the difference between the adjusted net worth and the available regulatory capital.
    This includes the net preference share capital of R779 million which is included as available regulatory capital. At 30 June 2017, this adjustment also includes the
    difference between Vitality Life Limited's Solvency II Pillar 1 Own Funds and its adjusted net worth and adds back the negative reserves eliminated on the Discovery
    funded VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence.

    The required capital at June 2017 for Life is R1 409 million (June 2016: R1 255 million), for Health and Vitality is R797 million (June 2016: R725 million), for
    VitalityHealth is R1 984 million (June 2016: R2 212 million) and for VitalityLife is R2 951 million (June 2016: R2 011 million (restated in-line with new capital position
    table above)). For Life, the required capital was set equal to two times the statutory Capital Adequacy Requirement. For Health and Vitality, the required capital was
    set equal to two times the monthly renewal expense and Vitality benefit cost. For VitalityHealth, the required capital amount was set equal to 1.4 times the
    Solvency II Pillar 1 Solvency Capital Requirement. For the VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence, the required capital was set equal to the UK Solvency I long
    term insurance capital requirement as per the agreement with Prudential. For the business sold on the Vitality Life Limited licence, the required capital was set
    equal to the excess of 1.4 times the Solvency II Pillar 1 Solvency Capital Requirement. The Regulatory Required Capital is calculated as the relevant regulatory
    solvency capital requirement for each insurance business.

(2) The tax variance for Life and Invest arises due to a movement in the deferred tax asset which delays the payment of tax. The tax variance for
    VitalityLife arises due to actual shareholder and policyholder tax being lower than expected.
(3) The projection term for Health and Vitality, Group Life and VitalityHealth at 30 June 2017 has not been changed from that used in the 30 June 2016
    embedded value calculation. Therefore, an experience variance arises because the total term of the in-force covered business is effectively
    increased by twelve months.

(1) For Life the reinsurance item primarily relates to the impact of the financing reinsurance arrangements. For VitalityHealth this includes a change
    in methodology where financial reinsurance cash flows have been removed from the value of in-force and deducted from the net worth.
(2) For VitalityHealth, the granularity, level and shape of the assumptions have been rebalanced to reflect experience. Furthermore, policy projections
    truncate all cash flows after the 20th anniversary of the policy from original date of inception.

(1) Health new business annualised premium income is the gross contribution to the medical schemes. The new business annualised
    premium income shown above excludes premiums in respect of members who join an existing employer where the member has
    no choice of medical scheme, as well as premiums in respect of new business written during the period but only activated after
    30 June 2017.
    The total Health and Vitality new business annualised premium income written over the period was R6 276 million (June 2016:
    R6 764 million).
(2) Included in the Life and Invest embedded value of new business is R109 million (June 2016: R159 million) in respect of investment
    management services provided on off balance sheet investment business.
    Risk business written prior to the valuation date allows certain Invest business to be written at financially advantageous terms, the
    impact of which has been recognised in the value of new business.
(3) Life new business is defined as Life policies to which Life became contractually bound during the reporting period, including policies
    whose first premium is due after the valuation date. Invest new business is defined as business where at least one premium has been
    received and which has not been refunded after receipt. Invest new business also includes Discovery Retirement Optimiser policies to
    which Life and Invest became contractually bound during the reporting period, including policies whose first premium is due after the
    valuation date.
    The new business annualised premium income of R2 840 million (June 2016: R2 798 million) (single premium APE: R1 169 million (June
    2016: R1 175 million)) shown above excludes automatic premium increases and servicing increases in respect of existing business. The
    total new business annualised premium income written over the period, including automatic premium increases of R1 172 million (June
    2016: R966 million) and servicing increases of R659 million (June 2016: R516 million), was R4 671 million (June 2016: R4 279 million)
    (single premium APE: R1 277 million (June 2016: R1 218 million)). Single premium business is included at 10% of the value of the
    single premium.
    Policy alterations and internal replacement policies, including Discovery Retirement Optimisers added to existing Life Plans, are shown
    in Table 5 as experience variances and not included as new business. Term extensions on existing contracts are not included as
    new business.
(4) The annualised profit margin is the value of new business expressed as a percentage of the present value of future premiums.
(5) From 30 June 2017, Discovery Retirement Optimiser policies fall under Invest. Therefore, the ""Annualised profit margin excluding Invest
    business"" at 30 June 2017 excludes Discovery Retirement Optimiser policies, whereas these policies are included in the comparative
    period. On a like-for-like basis to the comparative period the ""Annualised profit margin excluding Invest business"" at 30 June 2017
    would have been 9.5%.
(6) VitalityHealth new business is defined as individuals and employer groups which incepted during the reporting period. The new
    business annualised premium income shown above has been adjusted to exclude premiums in respect of members who join an
    existing employer group after the first month, as well as premiums in respect of new business written during the period but only
    activated after 30 June 2017.
(7) VitalityLife new business is defined as policies to which VitalityLife became contractually bound during the reporting period, including
    policies whose first premium is due after the valuation date.

(1) The United Kingdom Corporation tax rate assumed is 20% in 2017, 19% in 2018 to 2020, and 17% beyond that.
(2) VitalityHealth policies are projected for 20 years from the original date of inception.

The Discovery Limited embedded value is calculated based on a risk discount rate using the CAPM approach with specific reference to the Discovery beta coefficient.
The assumed beta is set with reference to the capital structure of the Group and the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time period. The beta is
calculated with reference to the ALSI. The resulting assumed beta will be fixed at this level unless the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time
period departs significantly from this assumption at the financial year end. As beta values reflect the historic performance of share prices relative to the market they
may not allow fully for non-market related and non-financial risk. Investors may want to form their own view on an appropriate allowance for these risks which have
not been modelled explicitly.

Life and Invest mortality, morbidity and lapse and surrender assumptions were derived from internal experience, where available, augmented by reinsurance and
industry information.

The Health and Vitality lapse assumptions were derived from the results of recent experience investigations.

The VitalityHealth assumptions were derived from internal experience, augmented by industry information.

VitalityLife assumptions were derived from internal experience, where available, augmented by reinsurance, industry and Discovery Limited group information.

Renewal expense assumptions were based on the results of the latest expense and budget information.

The initial expenses included in the calculation of the embedded value of new business are the actual costs incurred excluding expenses of an exceptional or
non-recurring nature.

The South African investment return assumption for Life and Invest and Health and Vitality was based on a single interest rate derived from the risk-free zero coupon
government bond yield curve. Other economic assumptions were set relative to this yield. The current and projected tax position of the policyholder funds within the
Life company has been taken into account in determining the net investment return assumption.

The best estimate investment return assumption for VitalityHealth and VitalityLife was based on the single interest rate derived from the risk-free zero coupon sterling
yield curve. The United Kingdom expense inflation assumption was set in line with long-term United Kingdom inflation expectations.

It is assumed that, for the purposes of calculating the cost of required capital, the Life and Invest required capital amount will be backed by surplus assets consisting of
100% equities and the Health, Vitality, VitalityHealth and Vitality Life Limited required capital amounts will be fully backed by cash. The VitalityLife business on the
Prudential licence required capital amount is assumed to earn the same return as the assets backing the VitalityLife policyholder liabilities. Allowance has been made
for tax and investment expenses in the calculation of the cost of required capital. In calculating the capital gains tax liability, it is assumed that the portfolio is realised
every 5 years. The Life and Invest cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the gross of tax equity return and the equity return net of tax and
expenses. The Health, Vitality, VitalityHealth and Vitality Life Limited cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the risk discount rate and the net
of tax cash return. The VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the risk discount rate and the
net of tax asset return assumption.

The embedded value has been calculated in accordance with the Actuarial Society of South Africa's Advisory Practice Note (""APN"") 107: Embedded Value Reporting,
except the recommended disclosure of Free Surplus and Required Capital has been adjusted to take into account the revised capital requirements and resources
arising from Solvency II in the United Kingdom as can be seen in Table 1 note 2.

Sensitivity to the embedded value assumptions

The risk discount rate uses the CAPM approach with specific reference to the Discovery beta coefficient. As beta values reflect the historic performance of share prices relative to the market they may not allow fully for non-market related and
non-financial risk. Investors may want to form their own view on an appropriate allowance for these risks which have not been modelled explicitly. The sensitivity of the embedded value and the embedded value of new business at 30 June 2017 to
changes in the risk discount rate is included in the tables below.

For each sensitivity illustrated below, all other assumptions have been left unchanged. No allowance has been made for management action such as risk premium increases where future experience is worse than the base assumptions.

TRADING STATEMENT: YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017 
 
In terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, issuers must publish a trading statement as soon as 
they have a reasonable degree of certainty that earnings per share and / or headline earnings per share 
for the next reporting period will differ by at least 20% from that of the previous corresponding period. 

Shareholders are advised that: 
       -  Headline earnings per share (undiluted) for the year ended 30 June 2017 (“current year”) is 
          expected to increase in the range of 18% to 22%, to between 674 cents and 697 cents over the 
          prior year ended 30 June 2016 (“prior year”) (2016: 571.1 cents); and 
       -  Earnings per share (undiluted) is expected to increase in the range of 18% to 22%, to between 
          676 cents and 699 cents (2016: 573.1 cents) over the prior year.  
 
It is practice for the Company to issue a trading statement on “normalized” headline earnings per share, 
which in management’s view best represents the underlying performance of the Group. 
 
 Accordingly, shareholders are advised that: 
       -  Normalised profit from operations is expected to increase by between 8% and 12% in the 
          current year over the prior year to between R6 920 million and R7 176 million (2016: R6 407 
          million).  
       -  Normalised headline earnings per share (undiluted) is expected to increase in the range of 5% to 
          8%, to between 710 cents and 730 cents over the prior year (2016: 676.3 cents); 
           
The reason for the difference in the growth rate between headline earnings per share and normalised 
headline earnings per share is largely as a result of non-recurring rebranding and business acquisition 
costs in the UK included in headline earnings in the prior year, which have reduced in the current year. 
Therefore, as management has previously maintained, reporting normalised headline earnings 
neutralises the impact of non-recurring items and is a more accurate reflection of the performance of 
the Group.  
 
Discovery’s results for the current year are due to be released on SENS on or about 18 September 2017. 
 
The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported 
on by the Company’s external auditors.

Shareholders are referred to the announcements released on the Stock Exchange News Service
on 16 February 2017 and 23 February 2017 in which they were advised, inter alia, that the
board of directors had resolved to declare interim gross cash dividends of:
-   529.31507 cents (449.91781 cents net of dividend withholding tax) per B preference
    share for the period 1 July 2016 to 31 December 2016 to shareholders recorded in the
    register of the Company on 10 March 2017; and

Commentary

Strong Group financial performance

Discovery delivered a strong performance for the half year ended 31 December 2016, with new business increasing by 15% to R8 245 million (excluding Discovery
Health's take-on of new closed schemes), and normalised profit from operations increasing by 13% to R3 412 million - this was despite economic headwinds in the
United Kingdom due to falling exchange and interest rates, the combination of which impacted Group earnings by 4%.

Discovery's operating model continued to deliver over the six months, comprising three powerful drivers of performance:

(1) The Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model: Businesses derive a unique competitive advantage through the model's profound impact on sales, selective lapses,
behaviour change and improved insurance risk, created by generating and sharing economic value with clients.

(2) An organic growth methodology: Operating profit growth of CPI +10% is targeted through a methodical and substantial investment in new initiatives, which evolve
into emerging businesses (with target profit growth of CPI +30%); and ultimately scale into established businesses (with target profit growth of CPI +5%).

(3) A sophisticated capital management philosophy: Discovery applies rigorous solvency assessments and standards to its businesses according to a five-year capital
plan, as well as a Group-wide buffer. This enables Discovery to provide a safety margin for emerging and new businesses, while additional capital is raised for new
initiatives of considerable scale.

The combination of these three components gives the Group confidence in reaching its 2018 Ambition of being the best insurance organisation globally, and a powerful
force for social good.


Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model and Discovery's organic growth methodology

Over the period, a deeper understanding of the mathematics underlying Discovery's Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model, and its manifestation in product design
across the Group, allowed for systemic improvement of engagement; behaviour change; differentiated mortality, morbidity and claims experience; and sharing the
value created with clients. This was evidenced by exceptional global adoption of and engagement in Vitality Active Rewards, with over one million members in South
Africa, the United Kingdom, United States, Hong Kong and China actively using the benefit - and over 100 000 new members using the benefit every month. The result
was an improvement in physical activity of over 25%, shown to have significant benefits in hindering the onset of disease and improving claims experience.

The Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model continued to gain scale over the period via the Global Vitality Network - a platform of leading international insurers using
Discovery's proprietary business model in their markets. The business model is now being employed across 14 markets, with Discovery accessing over 65% of the global
life insurance market by premium.

The efficacy of the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model gives the Group the confidence to grow according to the principles of the organic growth methodology as
outlined above. Over the period, this was evidenced by the performance of the respective businesses, as well as their progression through the growth cycle (from new
to emerging to established businesses). The established businesses delivered a solid performance of 11% growth in operating profit to R3 786 million, and 9% growth in
new business to R6 477 million.

Furthermore, the emerging businesses progressed, now comprising Discovery Insure, Ping An Health, and Vitality Group (the consolidation of The Vitality Group and
Discovery Partner Markets).

New business for the emerging businesses category grew 43% to R1 768 million, and they are all substantial businesses of value: Discovery Insure covers more than
160 000 vehicles and is expected to be profitable over the next half-year; Ping An Health is the leading health insurer in China, with new business growth of 55% over
the period; and Vitality Group is a rapidly growing global franchise with strong membership growth and 12 active markets.

Finally, new initiatives received an investment of R244 million, at 7% of earnings, and include Discovery's banking aspiration; the Global Vitality Network; and new
adjacent businesses. The latter include a commercial offering in Discovery Insure; the addition of Umbrella Funds in Discovery Invest; and a new investment venture by
Vitality UK, which will leverage the knowledge, infrastructure and expertise of Discovery Invest and the distribution network of VitalityLife.


Capital management philosophy

During the period under review, Discovery continued to apply its capital management philosophy to ensure the growth ambitions are appropriately funded. This is
based on maintaining independently robust levels of solvency cover within each of the regulated entities; planning explicitly for the expected future funding needs of
the current and planned growth businesses; and maintaining a central buffer to withstand potential adverse experience, as well as provide capacity for an element of
unplanned initiatives. A key premise of the philosophy is to ensure that where debt is used, it is maintained within acceptable limits. The Financial Leverage ratio is a
key measure used by the Group, and over the past year and the five-year planning horizon, it remains within the Board-approved limit, as do the available liquidity
resources after taking account of the range of capital resources available to the Group.

Discovery's approach to capital management served it well over the past year, ensuring that the Group made responsible and optimal use of a variety of appropriate
and efficient forms of funding. While the capital, debt and liquidity plans allow for known initiatives and a buffer for adverse scenarios, the buffer is not maintained at a
level to pursue new opportunities requiring significant additional capital.


Business-specific performance: South Africa


Discovery Health

Discovery Health continued to deliver excellent results during the period under review. Normalised operating profit increased by 12% to R1 188 million, and core new
business API increased by 20% to R3 030 million. During the period, Discovery Health was awarded the contract to administer SAB Medical Aid, bringing its restricted
scheme client base to 18 schemes and 581 821 lives under management, and total lives under management to 3 317 507 at the end of the period.

The Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) performed strongly during the 2016 calendar year. Net membership grew by 2% over the year, to a membership base of
2.74 million lives at year-end. Despite significant claims-cost pressures, Discovery Health's substantial ongoing investment in risk management interventions, systems
and assets to ensure effective claims-risk and fraud management, ensured that DHMS ended the year with a robust operating surplus, and capital reserves above the
statutory level of 25% of gross contributions.

Discovery Health continued its significant innovation and investment in the healthcare system and digital healthcare assets over the period. This included further
expansion in the homecare, pharmacy distribution and wellness operations; and enhanced value-based contracting with health professionals and hospital centres of
excellence. Discovery Health's fraud and forensics team alone saved over R405 million for its client schemes during the 2016 calendar year.

In addition, the period saw new investments and partnerships in data analytics and machine learning capabilities, as well as further enhancements in the functionality
and coverage of Discovery HealthID - the country's leading electronic health record system, which is now in regular use by over 1.2 million members and over 50% of
doctors treating Discovery Health clients. All of these investments ensure that members of Discovery Health's client schemes are part of an increasingly integrated
healthcare system.

Discovery Health maintains its firm support for the objectives of the proposed National Health Insurance (NHI) system, and continues to work closely with the National
Department of Health and all other stakeholders to ensure optimal policy outcomes. Discovery Health also continued to actively participate in the processes of the
Health Market Inquiry of the Competition Commission, which is expected to report its findings by the end of 2017.


Discovery Life

Discovery Life delivered a strong performance in growth and profit. New business grew by 9% (API including servicing and ACIs) to R1 053 million, compared with the
same period in the prior year, largely driven by individual new business which grew by 10.2%. Operating profit for the period increased by 13% to R1 768 million.

The Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model continued to exhibit encouraging results, both for Discovery Life and its policyholders. The impact of Discovery Life's
incentives for healthy lifestyle behaviours and outcomes have translated into exceptional Vitality engagement levels, with a 7-fold increase in the number of
policyholders on Gold and Diamond Vitality status over the past eight years. Mortality, morbidity and lapse experience are within expectation, with lapses at 94% of
expected on an Embedded Value (EV) basis. Policyholders benefited from Life PayBack benefits equivalent to 26% of individual Life claims (excluding PayBack)
- highlighting the value derived by healthy clients. The Value of In-Force (VIF) increased by an annualised 16% to R17 313 million from June 2016.

Product innovation as well as improved new business volume, mix, servicing and efficiencies, enabled a 20% increase in Value of New Business (VNB) when measured
on constant economic assumptions compared with the prior period. The recent launch of Vitality Underwriting, a first-of-its-kind dynamic underwriting method based
on client biometrics, combined with other product enhancements, has resulted in Discovery Life strengthening its market share in the retail affluent segment to 27.5%
(for January to September 2016), with both intermediated and tied channels experiencing positive growth.

Discovery Life remains well capitalised and generated over R1.5 billion in cash from the total existing book, which was utilised largely to continue funding further
growth of the Discovery Life and Invest businesses through new business acquisition.


Discovery Invest

Discovery Invest grew assets under management by 14% year-on-year to R64 billion, with new business growth of 9% to R1 278 million, dampened by weaker market
conditions. Operating profit grew to R326 million, 21% higher than the same period in the prior year. Discovery Invest maintained a position in the top 6 retail asset
takers in the industry in every quarter of 2016.

The business model of sharing economic value has resulted in over R4 billion in upfront investment boosts being awarded to Discovery Invest's over 250 000
policyholders.

During the period Discovery Invest extended its innovation in the retirement space by allowing investors to convert Discovery Miles and Vitality points into their
retirement plans, and becoming the first provider in South Africa to offer zero administration fees on retirement provision within certain conditions. Discovery Invest's
market share increased by 80% in the retirement annuity and preservation funds space, and by 50% in the retirement income space (year to end September 2016).


Discovery Insure

Discovery Insure showed significant new business growth for the six-month period, up 23% to R495 million, mainly driven by higher intermediated sales - which also
improved the quality of the in-force book. The gross written premium for the six-month period was R997m (up 33%) and the book now covers over 160 000 vehicles. The business continued to scale and is now close
to monthly breakeven. The combined ratio improved over the period to 103%, despite pressure on the loss ratio caused by two catastrophe-level storm events taking
place in the six-month period.

The Vitalitydrive model continues to produce excellent results, as members' engagement translates into better driving, and lower claims. This is evident in the continued
reduction in claim frequency over the period, and since inception (10% lower than inception). In addition, Discovery Insure broadened access to reward partners, and
addressed high-risk behaviour categories, such as night driving, through a strategic partnership with Uber.

Using telematics expertise and the footprint of Discovery clients across the country, Discovery Insure developed Crowdsearch - a technology which turns the
Vitalitydrive sensor into a beacon which can be located using the smartphones of the business's member base.


Intent to enter banking

Progress was made during the period regarding the intention to enter banking. On 25 October 2016, Discovery received authorisation from the Registrar of Banks to
establish a banking presence in South Africa, granted in terms of Section 13(1) of the Banks Act, Act No. 94 of 1990 (""Banks Act""), subject to certain conditions.

Pursuant to this authorisation, Discovery has a period of 12 months to fulfil the said conditions and make application for final approval in terms of Section 16 of the
Banks Act. The granting of a banking license pursuant to Section 17 of the Banks Act, and the timing of such grant, is subject to the approval and discretion of the
Registrar of Banks.

Progress is being made in developing the system infrastructure, operating processes, regulatory engagement and the customer value proposition. Subject to the above,
Discovery anticipates being in a position to launch its proposed banking offering during the course of 2018.


Business-specific performance: United Kingdom

Discovery's UK business, comprising VitalityHealth and VitalityLife, delivered a robust performance, in spite of economic headwinds including falling interest and
exchange rates, calculated to have dampened profits by £4 million for the period. This included a 6% increase in new business to £57.7 million, and a 10% increase in
normalised operating profit to £22.5 million (-11% to R1 024 million and -8% to R400 million in rand terms respectively, considering the 16% appreciation of the rand
over the period).

With over 950 000 clients and engagement at record levels, the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model is gaining traction in the UK market. There is also evidence of
significant behavioural change - since the launch of Active Rewards in May 2015, there has been an 8-fold increase in the number of engaged Vitality members reaching
weekly physical activity thresholds.

Allied to continued investment in brand, partner integration and service journeys, Vitality built on the success of the Active Rewards programme with the launch of a
new Apple Watch benefit, and HealthyFood through Ocado (an online supermarket). There were close to 9 000 Ocado registrations in the first two months of this
benefit, and 15 000 Apple Watch orders in the first four months of the benefit. Underpinned by the high levels of Vitality penetration and the proprietary Vitality
Shared-Value Insurance model, the claims and lapse experience continues to improve across both business lines.


VitalityLife

VitalityLife produced a steady performance in the face of a complex six-month period. This included an unpredictable economic climate with volatility in interest rates
and exchange rate movements. The net effect was an increase in new business of 8% in GBP, to 32.7 million (decrease of 10% in rand terms to R581 million).
Normalised profit decreased by 10% in GBP to 14.5 million (decrease of 25% in rand terms to R258 million), with the low interest rate environment accounting for an
estimated 22% decrease in profits.

VitalityLife saw continued adoption of the Vitality-integrated model over the period, with the Vitality Optimiser product comprising over 60% of all new business sales.
The period also witnessed better-than-expected overall claims experience dynamics (actual to expected claims of 85%, net of reinsurance), with optimised cases
showing significantly lower claims than non-optimised cases (optimised clients claim 14% less relative to non-optimised clients). Furthermore, VitalityLife's continued
product innovation saw a drive towards more capital-efficient products in terms of sales and business mix, highlighting its adaptability to an uncertain economic
climate.

VitalityLife achieved a market share of 13% for protection business in the Independent Financial Adviser space during the period. It also launched three new initiatives
which are all market-firsts in the UK: a Wellness Optimiser designed to reflect health-related behaviour change through discounts on health checks (premiums change
based on Vitality status); enhanced Severe Illness Cover (SIC) with a cancer relapse benefit, whereby following one year in remission, clients can get SIC if there is a
cancer relapse; and Vitality Nurses, a convenient online booking system with a nurse going to clients for their Vitality screening and non-laboratory based medical
diagnostic testing as part of underwriting.


VitalityHealth

The period was characterised by excellent actuarial dynamics, with a continuation of good loss ratio and retention performance; and 4% growth in new business in GBP
terms, driven predominantly by the individual market in which record sales of £13 million (up 20% on the prior year) were achieved. Overall, operating profit for H12017
grew from £4.4 million to £8 million (up 82%), with the in-force book generating £21 million over the period. From a balance sheet perspective, in September 2016, the
cash-based financial reinsurance structures were converted to cashless structures, resulting in around £50 million of reinsurance being repaid and a significant
reduction in future financing cost.

Engagement in the Vitality wellness programme has delivered clear benefits from both a claims and retention perspective. When engagement is tracked year-on-year,
VitalityHealth members who increased their wellness engagement had a claims cost around 20% lower than those who maintained their starting level of engagement.
The effect on the lapse rate was even more pronounced, with this being halved for Vitality members who were actively engaged.

The period under review was one of significant investment to further progress VitalityHealth's Shared-Value Insurance proposition. The product launch in September
2016 included a number of key enhancements to the wellness and Private Medical Insurance components of the VitalityHealth proposition. This included the addition of
Consultant Select, a consultant-led directional care pathway, and the introduction of a new approach to individual renewal pricing, which moves away from the
traditional no-claims-discount model.


Business-specific performance: Vitality Group

Over the period, Discovery Partner Markets in South Africa and The Vitality Group in the United States were consolidated into one entity, Vitality Group, with a unified
strategy, executive team and a consistent approach to product, partners and systems.


AIA Vitality

The period was noteworthy for AIA Vitality with Vitality-integrated insurance products now live in six AIA markets, and Vitality Active Rewards in the process of being
rolled out in an additional three markets. The Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model continues to create value, with significant increases in VNB and membership, as
well as a continued increase in Vitality penetration.


John Hancock Vitality and Manulife Vitality

John Hancock Vitality continued to experience strong penetration rates and the sales and engagement performance was in line with expectation. The launch in New
York State and the introduction of Apple Watch to all customers over the period were well received by the markets, and will drive a further increase in sales and
engagement.

Manulife Vitality successfully launched in the Canadian market in September 2016 offering Vitality on Family Term products.


Generali Vitality

Generali Vitality launched in Germany during July 2016 in the agency distribution channel with integrated disability and Term Life products. New business volumes have
been exceptional with the disability product volumes up by 60% and Term Life product volumes up 82% compared with the period leading up to the launch.

France launched its shared-value offering through various distribution channels on 9 January 2017, with Vitality being offered to corporate clients.


Business-specific performance: Ping An Health (PAH)

The business performed excellently over the period, reaching its stretch target of RMB 2 billion premium income for the year, with one million clients (an average of
3 871 clients were added each day in December 2016). The recently-developed internet products ended the year strongly with a premium run rate of RMB 1 million
each day, and attractive loss ratios.

Over 650 000 policyholders have joined Vitality Active Rewards through Ping An Life over the past five months, with current run rates of over 5 000 new activations each
day, and high levels of physical activity being recorded.

Importantly, Ping An Group sees the healthcare environment in China as a key strategic area. With PAH the designated health insurance specialist company, PAG will
leverage its impressive agency force to realise its ambition of being China's largest comprehensive healthcare player.

Fair value hierarchy of financial instruments

The Group's financial instruments measured at fair value have been disclosed using a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy has three levels that reflect the significance of
the inputs used in measuring fair value. These are as follows:

Level 1 includes financial instruments that are measured using unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for identical financial instruments. Quoted prices are
readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly
occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.

Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data. Instruments in this category are valued using:

(a) quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which are not considered to be active or

(b) valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.

Level 3 includes financial instruments that are valued using valuation techniques that incorporate information other than observable market data and where at least
one input (which could have a significant effect on instruments' valuation) cannot be based on observable market data.

                                                                                           31 December 2016

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments in level 2

- Discovery has invested in equity linked notes offered by international banks in order to back certain unit-linked contract liabilities. The calculation of the daily value of
the equity linked investments is made by the provider of the note. Discovery has procedures in place to ensure that these prices are correct. Aside from the daily
reasonableness checks versus similar funds and movement since the prior day's price, the fund values are calculated with reference to a specific formula or index,
disclosed to the policyholders, which is recalculated by Discovery in order to check if the price provided by the provider is correct.

- If a quoted market price is not available on a recognised stock exchange or from a broker for non-exchange traded financial instruments, the fair value of the
instrument is estimated by the asset managers, using valuation techniques including the use of recent arm's length market transactions, reference to the current fair
value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow techniques, option pricing models or other valuation techniques that provide a reliable
estimate of prices obtained in actual market transactions.

- The fair value of the hedged derivatives is calculated by the issuers of those instruments, as follows:

 (a) The fair value of call options is calculated on a Black-Scholes model.

 (b) The fair value of the return swaps is calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the instruments.

 (c) The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.

1 The inter-segment funding of R269 million reflects a notional allocation of interest earned on the negative reserve backing policyholders' funds of guaranteed investment products and hence is transferred to Discovery Invest.

The segment information is presented on the same basis as reported to the Chief Executive Officers of the reportable segments. The segment total is then adjusted for accounting reclassifications and entries required to produce IFRS compliant results. These adjustments include the following:
2 The VitalityLife results are reclassified to account for the contractual arrangement as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4.

3 The Discovery Unit Trusts (DUT) are consolidated into Discovery's results for IFRS purposes. In the Segment information the DUT column includes the effects of consolidating the unit trusts into Discovery's results, effectively being the income and expenses relating to units held by third parties.

4 Investment income on assets backing policyholder liabilities is included as part of the normalised profit from operations in the segmental disclosure, but is included together with shareholder investment income for IFRS purposes. Rebranding and business acquisitions expenses are excluded from normalised profit from operations, but are included in marketing and administration expenses for IFRS purposes.

1 The inter-segment funding of R215 million reflects a notional allocation of interest earned on the negative reserve backing policyholders' funds of guaranteed investment products and hence is transferred to Discovery Invest.
The segment information is presented on the same basis as reported to the Chief Executive Officers (CEO) of the reportable segments. At each reporting date, Discovery must review whether the segments being disclosed still comply with IFRS8 - Segment reporting. Based on this review, the following
changes were required:

2 Since the beginning of the current financial period, the performance of the Discovery Retirement Optimiser (DRO) product is reported to the CEO of Discovery Invest. DRO was previously reported as part of the SA Life segment. The comparatives have been restated to include the DRO product in the SA
Invest segment, in line with the current year disclosure.

3 The operating segments that were previously reported in the ""New Business Development"" segment no longer meet the aggregation criteria. As they do not meet the quantitative thresholds either, they have moved to the ""All other segments"" column. Comparative disclosure has been updated to be
consistent with the current year disclosure. New business development previously included The Vitality Group in the United States of America, Ping An Health in China, AIA Vitality in Asia and Discovery Insure in South Africa, as well as expenses incurred to investigate new products and markets.
The segment total, as reported to the Chief Executive Officers, is adjusted for accounting reclassifications and entries required to produce IFRS compliant results. These adjustments include the following:

4 The VitalityLife results are reclassified to account for the contractual arrangement as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4.

5 The Discovery Unit Trusts (DUT) are consolidated into Discovery's results for IFRS purposes. In the Segment information the DUT column includes the effects of consolidating the unit trusts into Discovery's results, effectively being the income and expenses relating to units held by third parties.

6 Investment income on assets backing policyholder liabilities is included as part of the normalised profit from operations in the segmental disclosure, but is included together with shareholder investment income for IFRS purposes. Rebranding and business acquisitions expenses are excluded from normalised profit from operations, but are included in marketing and administration expenses for IFRS purposes.

1 The new business API for Closed Schemes includes additional lives on existing closed schemes. The new business API for New Closed Schemes
includes contracted new business API and business in the first twelve months of on-boarding.

2 The comparative has been restated to include Discovery Retirement Optimiser (DRO) in the Discovery Invest new business API. This was previously
reported under Discovery Life.

3 Not annualised.

In the past two years, Discovery Health has brought on a number of new Closed Schemes, of varying sizes, resulting in large fluctuations in the new
business annualised premium income in the year of acquisition. By excluding the new business annualised premium income for these new schemes,
hence reducing the volatility caused, the new business annualised premium income for Discovery increased 15% for the six months ended 31
December 2016, when compared to the same period in the prior year.


Calculation of new business annualised premium income (API)

New business API is calculated at 12 times the monthly premium for new recurring premium policies and 10% of the value of new single premium
policies. It also includes both automatic premium increases and servicing increases on existing policies.

The new business API in the table above differs from the new business API disclosed in the embedded value largely as a result of:

- The timing of inclusion of policyholders in the calculation of new business API - In the embedded value, new business is included from the earlier of
the date that the first premium has been received or when the policy is on risk, whereas in the table above, new business is included when the policy
has been contractually committed.

- Inclusion of automatic premium increases and servicing increases on existing life policies - These are included in the table above but excluded in
the embedded value API values disclosed.

For Vitality Group and Ping An Health, the embedded value definition of new business is used in the table above.

Refer to the footnotes to Table 7: Embedded Value of New Business for a more detailed description of the differences in new business disclosures
between the embedded value and the table above.

Significant transactions affecting the current results


Increase in borrowings

United Kingdom borrowings

During the current financial period, VitalityLife utilised the remaining GBP 30 million of its facilities with HSBC Bank Plc, totalling GBP 150 million. These borrowings have
been used to fund the new business acquisition costs incurred. These costs were previously funded by The Prudential Assurance Company Limited and disclosed as
Negative Reserve Funding in the Statement of financial position.

GBP 7.5 million of this facility was repaid on 31 May 2016 and 30 November 2016 respectively. The balance owing to HSBC Bank Plc as at 31 December 2016 amounts
to GBP 135 million (R2 287 million) (30 June 2016: GBP 112.5 million (R2 226 million)).

Interest rates on the HSBC facilities are floating, linked to 3 month LIBOR, payable quarterly in arrears. Finance charges of R29 million in respect of these borrowings
have been recognised in profit or loss.


South African borrowings

During the current financial period, Discovery utilised an additional R825 million of its bank syndicated loan programme entered into in June 2016. The amount
outstanding under this programme totals R3 856 million (30 June 2016: R3 014 million), including accrued interest.

The additional R825 million facility has the following profile:

- R375 million has been fixed over a 5 year term at 10.39% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, with capital repayable on 30 September 2021.

- R450 million is linked to 3 month JIBAR, currently 9.79% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, with capital repayable on 15 December 2021.

Furthermore, a subsidiary of the Discovery Group concluded a 10 year loan facility agreement of R650 million with Investec Bank Limited, of which R189 million was
utilised in the current financial period. Interest rates on the utilised amount is fixed at a weighted average rate of 11.44% per annum, with capital and interest
repayable in instalments over the duration of the loan facility.

The Group entered into various finance leases during the current financial period in the ordinary course of business, totalling a net increase of R86 million.

Finance charges of R96 million in respect of these South African borrowings have been recognised in profit or loss.


Negative reserve funding

The negative reserve funding liability on Discovery's Statement of financial position represents the acquisition costs that were funded by Prudential on behalf of
VitalityLife. The liability unwinds and is repaid on a matched basis as the cash flows emerge from the assets arising from insurance contracts. In the event that the cash
flows do not emerge as anticipated, VitalityLife would be required to repay these liabilities from other resources.

The decrease in the negative reserve funding liability relates to the repayment of funding by VitalityLife in the current financial period.


Expiry of BEE transaction

In September 2005, Discovery concluded a BEE transaction pursuant to which 38 725 909 shares were issued to a consortium of BEE parties. 1 106 455 of these shares
were issued to the Maphai SPV being one of the BEE consortium members, at R0.001 each, for an initial period of 11 years (initial period).

The difference between the market value of the ordinary shares issued to the BEE parties and the subscription consideration of R1.72 per share, represented an
outstanding funded amount provided by Discovery shareholders (funded amount). These shares were treated as treasury shares.

At the end of the initial period,

- Discovery had the right to repurchase such number of ordinary shares at R0.001 per share that would provide Discovery with a notional return of the funded amount.

- In order for the Maphai SPV to retain the full number of Discovery shares originally issued to them, the Maphai SPV then had the right to simultaneously acquire from
Discovery, at the then thirty-day volume-weighted average price per Discovery share, the same number of shares repurchased by Discovery.

The initial period expired in December 2016 and resulted in the following transactions:

- Discovery repurchased 582 954 Discovery shares held by the Maphai SPV at a price of R0.001 per Discovery share.

- The Maphai SPV chose not to exercise their right to acquire the shares repurchased by Discovery. These shares have been cancelled from issue.

As a result of this transaction, treasury shares have decreased by 1 200 554 shares, representing all shares previously held by the Maphai SPV.

All amounts funded in terms of the September 2005 BEE transaction have now been repaid.


Consolidation of Discovery Unit Trusts

The Discovery Unit Trusts are consolidated into Discovery's results in both the current and prior financial year. The following large increases in the Discovery Unit
Trusts' Statement of financial position have had a direct impact on the Group's Statement of financial position:

- Cash and cash equivalents decreased by R1 259 million.

- Loans and receivables decreased by R655 million.

- Trade and other payables decreased by R1 727 million.

- Investments at fair value through profit or loss increased by R1 728 million.

- Investment contracts at fair value through profit or loss increased by R491 million.


Other significant items in these results

Increase in the DiscoveryCard profit share arrangement in the prior period

In December 2015, Discovery increased its economic interest in the DiscoveryCard (a ""Discovery"" branded FNB credit card), by subscribing for R1.4 billion redeemable
preference shares in the share capital of FirstRand Bank Limited (FRB). This entitled Discovery to receive an additional 54.99% of the profits generated by the
DiscoveryCard effective from 1 July 2015.

The contractual rights under the preference shares were only finalised in April 2016 and as such, any profits earned prior to that represented an adjustment to the
purchase price rather than income received. At 31 December 2015, the after tax profit share in respect of the additional 54.99% was calculated as R58 million and, in
order to reflect the economic effect of the transaction, was added to Normalised Headline Earnings. R71 million has been recognised in profit or loss in respect of the
54.99% profits generated by the DiscoveryCard for the six month period ended 31 December 2016 and has been included in Normalised profit from operations.

In terms of IAS 38: Intangible Assets, the preference shares have been disclosed as an intangible asset in the Statement of financial position as the substance of the
arrangement is a right to receive additional 54.99% of the profits generated by the DiscoveryCard. This intangible asset is amortised through profit or loss as profits are
expected to emerge. R42 million amortisation has been recognised for the current financial period. This has been added back in the calculation of Normalised Headline
Earnings.


Taxation

For South African entities that are in a tax paying position, tax has been provided at 28% (2015: 28%) in the financial statements. No deferred tax assets have been
recognised on the assessed losses in Discovery Insure and Vitality Group and no further deferred tax asset has been raised in respect of the VitalityHealth assessed
losses.


Material transactions with related parties

Discovery Health administers the Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) and provides managed care services for which it charges an administration fee and a
managed healthcare fee respectively. These fees are determined on an annual basis and approved by the trustees of DHMS. The fees totalled R2 448 million for the six
months ended 31 December 2016 (2015: R2 285 million). Discovery offers the members of DHMS access to the Vitality programme.


Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss have increased by R2.8 billion due to the sale of Discovery Invest products. This includes the impact of consolidating
the Discovery Unit Trusts into the Group's results. The increase in the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss has been presented in 'Net purchase of
investments held to back policyholder liabilities' of R3 205 million in the Statement of cash flows.


Deferred tax liability

The deferred tax liability is primarily attributable to the application of the Financial Services Board directive 145. This directive allows for the zeroing on a statutory basis
of the assets arising from insurance contracts. The statutory basis is used when calculating tax payable for Discovery Life, resulting in a timing difference between the
tax base and the accounting base.

A new tax basis for Life companies was promulgated in January 2017. The effective date of the new 'adjusted IFRS' tax valuation basis will align with the implementation
of Solvency Assessment and Management (SAM).

Interim dividend declaration

The Company is assessing the implications of Minister Gordhan's announcement of an increase in the dividend withholding tax rate from 15% to 20%, in his budget speech of 22 February 2017.

Capital

At 31 December 2016, the capital adequacy requirement on the statutory basis for Discovery Life was R684 million (2015: R549 million) and was covered 3.2 times
(2015: 3.9 times). Vitality Life Limited's actual solvency was 218% of the required capital.


Accounting policies

The interim results have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards including IAS 34, as well as the South African Companies Act 71
of 2008. The accounting policies adopted are consistent with the accounting policies applied in the prior Annual Financial Statements.


Embedded value statement
for the six months ended 31 December 2016

The embedded value of Discovery consists of the following components:

- the adjusted net worth attributed to the business at the valuation date;

- plus: the present value of expected future shareholder cash flows from the in-force covered business;

- less: the cost of required capital.

The present value of future shareholder cash flows from the in-force covered business is calculated as the value of projected future after-tax shareholder cash flows of
the business in-force at the valuation date, discounted at the risk discount rate.

The value of new business is the present value, at the point of sale, of the projected future after-tax shareholder cash flows of the new business written by Discovery,
discounted at the risk discount rate, less an allowance for the reserving strain, initial expenses and cost of required capital. The value of new business is calculated
using the current reporting date assumptions.

For Life, the shareholder cash flows are based on the release of margins under the Statutory Valuation Method (""SVM"") basis.

The embedded value includes the insurance and administration profits of the covered business in the Discovery Limited group. Covered business includes business
written in South Africa through Discovery Life (""Life""), Discovery Invest (""Invest""), Discovery Health (""Health"") and Discovery Vitality (""Vitality""), and in the United Kingdom
through VitalityLife and VitalityHealth. For The Vitality Group (USA), Ping An Health and Discovery Insure, no published value has been placed on the current in-force
business as the businesses have not yet reached suitable scale with predictable experience.

In August 2011, Discovery raised R800 million through the issue of non-cumulative, non-participating, non-convertible preference shares. For embedded value purposes
this capital, net of share issue expenses, has been excluded from the adjusted net worth.

In June 2015, the methodology to derive the assumed beta was amended. Under this revised methodology, the assumed beta is set with reference to the observed beta
calculated using daily returns over a long time period and with reference to the ALSI. The resulting assumed beta is then fixed at this level unless the observed beta
calculated using daily returns over a long time period departs significantly from this assumption at the financial year end. The beta assumption used at 31 December
2016 is 0.75 (30 June 2016: 0.75; 31 December 2015: 0.55).

In December 2015, the initial period expired on the BEE transaction that was concluded in September 2005 with the Discovery Foundation. In the transaction, shares
were issued to the Discovery Foundation at R0.001 per share for an initial period of 10 years. At the end of this initial period Discovery has the right to repurchase these
ordinary shares at R0.001 per share which would provide Discovery with the notional return of the funded amount. Simultaneously, the Discovery Foundation has the
right to acquire from Discovery the same number of shares repurchased by Discovery. At the expiry of the initial period, the above transactions were executed resulting
in an increased share capital and premium of R817 million and a decrease of 14 226 181 treasury shares.

In January 2016, the European insurance regulation Solvency II came into effect and Vitality Life Limited was granted a life insurance licence in the United Kingdom on
which it commenced writing new business. These two changes required that the embedded value methodology for VitalityLife be reviewed. The key methodology
change was the zeroisation of the negative reserves emerging under insurance contracts in Vitality Life Limited and Discovery funded VitalityLife business on the
Prudential licence. This effectively moves the negative reserve from net worth to the value of in-force.

The 31 December 2016 embedded value results and disclosures were not subjected to an external review or audit.

The excess of available regulatory capital over adjusted net worth reflects the difference between the adjusted net worth and the available regulatory capital. This includes the
net preference share capital of R779 million which is included as available regulatory capital. At 31 December 2016, this adjustment also includes the difference between
Vitality Life Limited's Solvency II Pillar 1 Own Funds and its adjusted net worth and adds back the negative reserves eliminated on the Discovery funded VitalityLife business on
the Prudential licence.

The required capital at December 2016 for Life is R1 369 million (June 2016: R1 255 million; December 2015: R1 098 million), for Health and Vitality is R751 million
(June 2016: R725 million; December 2015: R683 million), for VitalityHealth and VitalityHealth Insurance Limited is R1 931 million (June 2016: R2 212 million;
December 2015: R2 590 million) and for VitalityLife is R2 387 million (June 2016: R2 011 million (restated in line with new capital positon table above); December 2015:
R1 228 million). For Life, the required capital was set equal to two times the statutory Capital Adequacy Requirement. For Health and Vitality, the required capital was
set equal to two times the monthly renewal expense and Vitality benefit cost. For VitalityHealth, the required capital amount was set equal to 1.4 times the Solvency II
Pillar 1 Solvency Capital Requirement. For the VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence, the required capital was set equal to the UK Solvency I long term insurance
capital requirement as per the agreement with Prudential. For the business sold on the Vitality Life Limited licence, the required capital was set equal to the excess of
1.4 times the Solvency II Pillar 1 Solvency Capital Requirement. The Regulatory Required Capital is calculated as the relevant regulatory solvency capital requirement for
each insurance business.

the current transaction value.

1 The premium and fee income experience for Life arises largely due to the impact of Vitality distribution shifts compared to expected levels.

2 The tax variance for Life and Invest arises due to a movement in the deferred tax asset which delays the payment of tax. The tax variance for
VitalityLife arises due to actual shareholder and policyholder tax being higher than expected.

3 The projection term for Health and Vitality, Group Life and VitalityHealth at 31 December 2016 has not been changed from that used in the 30 June
2016 embedded value calculation. Therefore, an experience variance arises because the total term of the in-force covered business is effectively
increased by six months.

1 Health new business annualised premium income is the gross contribution to the medical schemes. The new business annualised premium income
shown above excludes premiums in respect of members who join an existing employer where the member has no choice of medical scheme, as well
as premiums in respect of new business written during the period but only activated after 31 December 2016.

The total Health and Vitality new business annualised premium income written over the period was R3 122 million (June 2016: R6 764 million;
December 2015: R4 028 million).

2 Included in the Life and Invest embedded value of new business is R93 million (June 2016: R159 million; December 2015: R48 million) in respect of
investment management services provided on off balance sheet investment business.

Risk business written prior to the valuation date allows certain Invest business to be written at financially advantageous terms, the impact of which
has been recognised in the value of new business.

3 Life new business is defined as Life policies to which Life became contractually bound during the reporting period, including policies whose first
premium is due after the valuation date. Invest new business is defined as business where at least one premium has been received and which has not
been refunded after receipt. Invest new business also includes Discovery Retirement Optimiser policies to which Life and Invest became contractually
bound during the reporting period, including policies whose first premium is due after the valuation date.

The new business annualised premium income of R1 437 million (June 2016: R2 798 million; December 2015: R1 366 million) (single premium APE: R592 million
(June 2016: R1 175 million; December 2015: R555 million)) shown above excludes automatic premium increases and servicing increases in respect of
existing business. The total Life new business annualised premium income written over the period, including automatic premium increases of
R574 million (June 2016: R966 million; December 2015: R498 million) and servicing increases of R320 million (June 2016: R516 million; December 2015:
R274 million) was R2 331 million (June 2016: R4 279 million; December 2015: R2 138) (single premium APE: R620 million (June 2016: R1 218 million;
December 2015: R579 million)). Single premium business is included at 10% of the value of the single premium.

Policy alterations and internal replacement policies, including Discovery Retirement Optimisers added to existing Life Plans, are shown in Table 5 as
experience variances and not included as new business. Term extensions on existing contracts are not included as new business.

4 The annualised profit margin is the value of new business expressed as a percentage of the present value of future premiums.

5 From 31 December 2016, Discovery Retirement Optimiser policies fall under Invest. Therefore, the ""Annualised profit margin excluding Invest
business"" at 31 December 2016 excludes Discovery Retirement Optimiser policies, whereas these policies are included in the two comparative periods.
On a like-for-like basis to the comparative periods the ""Annualised profit margin excluding Invest business"" at 31 December 2016 would have been
9.9%.

6 VitalityHealth new business is defined as individuals and employer groups which incepted during the reporting period. The new business
annualised premium income shown above has been adjusted to exclude premiums in respect of members who join an existing employer group after
the first month, as well as premiums in respect of new business written during the period but only activated after 31 December 2016.

7 VitalityLife new business is defined as policies to which VitalityLife became contractually bound during the reporting period, including policies whose
first premium is due after the valuation date.

1 The United Kingdom Corporation tax rate assumed is 20% in 2017, 19% in 2018 to 2020, and 17% beyond that.


The Discovery Limited embedded value is calculated based on a risk discount rate using the CAPM approach with specific reference to the Discovery beta coefficient.
The assumed beta is set with reference to the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time period. The beta is calculated with reference to the ALSI.
The resulting assumed beta will be fixed at this level unless the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time period departs significantly from this
assumption at the financial year end. As beta values reflect the historic performance of share prices relative to the market they may not allow fully for non-market
related and non-financial risk. Investors may want to form their own view on an appropriate allowance for these risks which have not been modelled explicitly.

Life and Invest mortality, morbidity and lapse and surrender assumptions were derived from internal experience, where available, augmented by reinsurance and
industry information.

The Health and Vitality lapse assumptions were derived from the results of recent experience investigations.

The VitalityHealth assumptions were derived from internal experience, augmented by industry information.

VitalityLife assumptions were derived from internal experience, where available, augmented by reinsurance, industry and Discovery Limited group information.

Renewal expense assumptions were based on the results of the latest expense and budget information.

The initial expenses included in the calculation of the embedded value of new business are the actual costs incurred excluding expenses of an exceptional or
non-recurring nature.

The South African investment return assumption for Life and Invest and Health and Vitality was based on a single interest rate derived from the risk-free zero coupon
government bond yield curve. Other economic assumptions were set relative to this yield. The current and projected tax position of the policyholder funds within the
Life company has been taken into account in determining the net investment return assumption.

The best estimate investment return assumption for VitalityHealth and VitalityLife was based on the single interest rate derived from the risk-free zero coupon sterling
yield curve. The United Kingdom expense inflation assumption was set in line with long-term United Kingdom inflation expectations.

It is assumed that, for the purposes of calculating the cost of required capital, the Life and Invest required capital amount will be backed by surplus assets consisting of
100% equities and the Health, Vitality, VitalityHealth and Vitality Life Limited required capital amounts will be fully backed by cash. The VitalityLife business on the
Prudential licence required capital amount is assumed to earn the same return as the assets backing the VitalityLife policyholder liabilities. Allowance has been made
for tax and investment expenses in the calculation of the cost of required capital. In calculating the capital gains tax liability, it is assumed that the portfolio is realised
every 5 years. The Life and Invest cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the gross of tax equity return and the equity return net of tax and
expenses. The Health, Vitality, VitalityHealth and Vitality Life Limited cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the risk discount rate and the net
of tax cash return. The VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the risk discount rate and the
net of tax asset return assumption.

The embedded value has been calculated in accordance with the Actuarial Society of South Africa's Advisory Practice Note (""APN"") 107: Embedded Value Reporting,
except the recommended disclosure of Free Surplus and Required Capital has been adjusted to take into account the revised capital requirements and resources
arising from Solvency II in the United Kingdom as can be seen in Table 1 note 2.


Sensitivity to the embedded value assumptions

The risk discount rate uses the CAPM approach with specific reference to the Discovery beta coefficient. As beta values reflect the historic performance of share prices relative to the market they may not allow fully for non-market related and non-financial risk.
Investors may want to form their own view on an appropriate allowance for these risks which have not been modelled explicitly. The sensitivity of the embedded value and the embedded value of new business at 31 December 2016 to changes in the risk discount rate
is included in the tables below.

For each sensitivity illustrated below, all other assumptions have been left unchanged. No allowance has been made for management action such as risk premium increases where future experience is worse than the base assumptions.

VOLUNTARY TRADING STATEMENT: SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016

Shareholders are advised that:
   - Normalised profit from operations is expected to increase by between 10% and 15% for the six
     months ended 31 December 2016 (“current period”) over the corresponding prior period (“prior
     period”) to between R3 316 million and R3 467 million (2015: R3 015 million).
   - Normalised headline earnings per share (undiluted) is expected to increase in the range of 0% to
     5%, to between 336.6 cents and 353.4 cents over the prior period (2015: 336.6 cents);
   - Headline earnings per share (undiluted) is expected to increase in the range of 10% to 15%, to
     between 308.7 cents and 322.7 cents over the prior period (2015: 280.6 cents); and
   - Earnings per share (undiluted) is expected to increase in the range of 10% to 15%, to between
     309.1 cents and 323.2 cents (2015: 281.0 cents).

The reason for the difference in the growth rate between Normalised profit from operations and
Normalised headline earnings per share is that the capital raised in the rights issue of April 2015 was
only deployed at the end of the prior period, in December 2015. The effect of this was higher interest
income and lower finance charges in the prior period. It is expected that this difference in growth rate
will narrow for the Group's full financial year.

Discovery’s results for the current period are due to be released on SENS on 23 February 2017.

The financial information on which this voluntary trading statement is based has not been reviewed and
reported on by the Company’s external auditors.

EXPIRY OF THE MAPHAI SPV BEE TRANSACTION

Shareholders are referred to the circular issued to Discovery shareholders on 15 November 2005
(“Circular”) and approved at a general meeting of the Company held on 8 December 2005, relating to a
Black Economic Empowerment (""BEE"") transaction, pursuant to which Discovery issued 7.05% of
Discovery’s then issued share capital to a consortium of BEE parties ( “BEE Transaction”). In terms of the
BEE Transaction, Discovery issued 1,106,455 shares (0.50% of Discovery’s then issued share capital) at
R0.001 each to the Maphai SPV, being one of the BEE Transaction consortium members, for an initial
period of 11 years (“Initial Period”).

Pursuant to the BEE Transaction, and as described in the Circular, Discovery and the Maphai SPV entered
into a subscription agreement (“Maphai SPV Agreement”) regulating, amongst other things:
- the issue of the abovementioned Discovery shares to the Maphai SPV;
- a call option granted to Discovery to repurchase such number of shares at R0.001 per share, as
  calculated with reference to an agreed formula, so as to provide Discovery with a notional
  return on the notional commencement amount, at the end of Initial Period; and
- the right of the Maphai SPV to subscribe for the same number of shares repurchased by
  Discovery in terms of the call option referred to above, within 30 days of expiry of the Initial
  Period, in order to restore the Maphai SPV’s shareholding in the Company to the level held
  prior to Discovery’s exercise of the call option/repurchase.

According to the Maphai SPV Agreement, the call option is deemed to be automatically exercised by
Discovery at the end of the Initial Period.

Shareholders are advised that the Initial Period has expired and that Discovery has exercised its call
option to repurchase such number of shares at R0.001 per share, as calculated with reference to an
agreed formula, so as to provide Discovery with a notional return on the notional commencement
amount, at the end of Initial Period.

Accordingly, Discovery has repurchased 582 954 Discovery shares (“repurchased shares”) held by the
Maphai SPV, at a price of R0.001 per Discovery share, using the 30 day VWAP to 9 December 2016 of
R113.40, as the reference price per the Maphai SPV agreement.

The Company has received authorization from the JSE for the delisting and cancelation of the
repurchased shares which will be restored forthwith to the status of authorized shares of the Company.

Commentary


01 Strong Group financial performance

The full-year period ending 30 June 2016 witnessed a strong performance by the Group. New business increased by 22% to R16.2 billion (excluding R4.2 billion
in respect of the Bankmed Medical Scheme administration and managed care services contract recorded in the prior year); normalised profit from operations
increased by 11% to R6.4 billion; profit from existing businesses increased 15% to R7.2 billion; and spend on new initiatives grew substantially by 73% to
R823 million.

The financial performance for the period was characterised by three distinctive features:

1. Solid performance by existing businesses, with new business up 20% to R13.3 billion, and operating profit up 15% to R7.2 billion. Coupled with this, an
   acceleration of Group performance was witnessed in the second half of the financial year. Group operating profit increased by 14% in the second six
   months of the financial year compared to the same period in the prior year, versus 7% in the first six months. This was driven by Discovery Health and
   Discovery Life which delivered normalised operating profit growth of 12% and 18% respectively for H2 2016 versus H2 2015; and Discovery Insure, whose
   new business grew 14% in H2 2016 versus H2 2015. In addition, VitalityHealth's performance was notable for its progress in the second six months with new
   business up 62% and normalised profit up 55% in Rand terms for H2 2016 when compared to the same 6-month period in the prior year.
2. A substantial spend on new initiatives. While gross revenue growth (+20%) (excluding collections on behalf of third parties) and new business growth (+22%)
   remained strong, Discovery spent R823 million on new initiatives over the course of the year, funded by both debt and a rights issue. This marked a 73%
   increase over the prior year, and 13% of earnings. This investment had a dampening effect on short-term profits, though is expected to be profit enhancing
   in the long term. Normalised headline earnings were R4.3 billion (+7%); and normalised headline earnings per share grew 1%, diluted through the additional
   capital raised in the rights issue.
3. Robust performance in spite of a volatile economic environment. In Discovery's Primary Market of South Africa, this included a depreciating currency
   (ZAR to USD); rising interest rates; and economic assumption changes. In Discovery's second Primary Market of the United Kingdom (UK), Discovery faced
   both currency sensitivity (ZAR to GBP) and a record-low interest rate environment, the result of the UK's intended exit from the European Union. Headline
   earnings and solvency levels remained robust in spite of this economic volatility; with the environment predominantly impacting Embedded Value growth,
   which came out fairly flat (+2% to R53 billion). This is consistent with Discovery's view that the business model is well immunised against economic
   fluctuations. The Embedded Value growth stripping out these effects would have been 10.5% to R58 billion.


02 The Vitality Shared-Value Insurance Model is now well developed and is being replicated globally

The Group's performance is contextualised by Discovery's business model - ""Vitality Shared-Value Insurance"". Over the period, the efficacy of the Vitality
Shared-Value Insurance model matured, in terms of Discovery's understanding of the mathematics that underpin value creation in a shared-value insurance
context. This includes Discovery's proprietary methodology in structuring incentives to optimise behaviour change, and its understanding of the behavioural
impact on insurance risk.

The model's relevance is validated by the success in both of Discovery's Primary Markets, which continued to gain market share and demonstrate robustness in
new business and financial performance; and in the expansion of the Vitality Network for Discovery's Partner Markets. The Vitality Shared-Value Insurance
model is now present in 14 markets around the world, with Generali going live during the past six months, and more recently, the announcement of a
partnership with Sumitomo Life in Japan ($31,100 million revenue in 2015 and ranked 335 according to Fortune 500 2016). In addition, past investment is now
yielding evidence of the efficacy of the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model in the more established Partner Markets.

This justifies Discovery's strategy for existing businesses; for the consistent rollout of the model to new geographies and adjacencies, the most recent being the
intention to enter banking in South Africa; and for continued rollout of the Vitality Active Rewards with Apple Watch methodology, a global collaboration with
Apple. The success of Vitality Active Rewards with Apple Watch in changing wellness behaviour and segmenting insurance risk in South Africa and the United
States has advanced the science underpinning the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model. Results over the first six months of the Vitality Active Rewards benefit
showed dramatic and sustained behaviour change, with a 20% increase in physical activity for those who engaged in the benefit, and 81% for those who also
took the Apple Watch. This is the most successful benefit to date, as measured by take-up and engagement, and shows strong initial insurance applications,
with engaged members demonstrating significantly lower morbidity and mortality experience than other Vitality members. Last week, the benefit was launched
in China through Ping An Life. The benefit will be attached to Ping An Life's flagship life insurance product, available through its one million strong agency force,
and presents a meaningful opportunity to elevate the Vitality brand in China. Active Rewards will be rolled out globally over the next 12 months.


03 Robust performance by existing businesses

1. South Africa

Discovery Health

Discovery Health's performance exceeded expectation during the period under review. Normalised operating profit increased by 12% to R2,265 million, and
new business API increased off a significant base by 22% to R6,577 million (excluding the Bankmed Medical Scheme taken on in the prior year).

The period was characterised by high healthcare inflation, mainly driven by higher hospital utilisation. Despite these pressures, Discovery Health and Discovery
Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) continued to perform strongly, as a result of ongoing investment in best-in-class health system innovation. In DHMS, lives
administered grew by 1.5% to 2.7 million; and the solvency ratio remained above the statutory 25% of gross annual contribution income, with the Scheme
retaining its industry-leading AA+ rating from Global Credit Ratings for the 15th consecutive year. Discovery Health maintained its strong progress in the
restricted scheme environment, and now has a total of 17 leading corporate schemes under management, comprising a total of 550,943 beneficiaries, and with
several promising prospects for additional clients in the pipeline.

Discovery Health continued its significant investment in digital healthcare assets over the period, with further expansion in the functionality and coverage of
HealthID, the country's leading electronic health record system. This is now in regular use by over one million members and almost 50% of doctors treating
members of Discovery Health's client schemes. The DHMS fully-digital healthcare plan - the Smart Plan - has continued to prove very successful in attracting a
younger demographic (average age four years younger), leveraging Discovery Health's analytic and digital assets.

Discovery Health maintains its strong support for the objectives of the proposed National Health Insurance (NHI) system. It is working closely with the
Department of Health and all other stakeholders with the aim of ensuring that the final NHI policy is optimal and leverages the assets of the private healthcare
system. Over the period, Discovery Health participated actively in the processes of the Health Market Inquiry of the Competition Commission, which is expected
to report by end 2016.


Discovery Life

Discovery Life delivered a strong performance, with an acceleration over the latter half of the financial year. Individual life new business activations (API Rm)
grew by 10% to R383 million compared to H2 2015 (by 5% to R2,347 million for the full-year period), with further acceleration in the fourth quarter. Operating
profit increased by 18% in H2 to R1,780 million compared to the same period in the prior year (by 14% to R3,373 million for the full-year period).

Value In-Force (VIF) increased by 10.9% using constant economic assumptions. When taking the more conservative risk discount rate assumption into account
driven by an increased beta adjustment at the end of the period, the VIF reduced by 1.6% to R18.9 billion. Similarly, a VNB margin of 8.9% as at the end of June
2016 was achieved on the back of improving new business mix. Discovery Life remains well capitalised and generated R2,101 million in cash from the existing
book, which was utilised largely to continue funding further growth of the Discovery Life business through new business acquisition.

Discovery Life has increased its market share in the retail affluent segment to 28.8% as the leading insurer. Underlying this growth is a strong adviser force,
with industry sales statistics indicating that Discovery Life tied advisers are up to three times more productive than their counterparts. In addition, a hybrid
distribution strategy has shown to be effective with strong growth, accompanied by clear cost efficiencies in the direct channel.

Despite a challenging economic environment, the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model continued to exhibit encouraging results, both for Discovery Life and
its members. Discovery Life benefited from lapse rates that were significantly lower than expected (84% of expected), particularly for policies integrated with
Discovery Health and those with higher Vitality statuses. Members benefited from paybacks from actuarial surplus of 18% of claims value - highlighting the
value derived by healthy clients.


Discovery Invest

The performance of Discovery Invest over the period was excellent. New business grew by 17% to R1,932 million year-on-year; assets under management
increased by 21% to over R60 billion; and operating profit grew by 22% to R563 million. Net asset management fee income increased by 46%, a consequence of
efficiencies from increased scale.

The business saw strong acceptance of the range of shared-value retirement products launched towards the end of 2015. These products recognise higher
retirement needs given increased longevity as a result of better health, and reward clients for responsible withdrawals.


2. United Kingdom

The period was noteworthy for its continued investment in the Vitality brand. This contributed to a strong retail and consumer presence; impressive new
business growth; and in Vitality engagement increasing to record levels. In addition, VitalityHealth was recognised as New Brand of the Year at the Marketing
Society Excellence Awards.


VitalityLife

VitalityLife produced a strong performance in the face of complex changes: a volatile economic climate, including positive exchange rate movements;
record-low interest rates and the impact of Solvency II; and moving onto its own licence. The net effect of this is that new business increased 23% in Rand
terms to R1,332 million (up 4% in GBP) and normalised profit grew by 25% to R678 million (up 5% in GBP). VitalityLife achieved market share of 11.7% in the
Independent Financial Advisor space and continued to grow its distribution footprint, now at 20 franchises.

VitalityLife achieved success in positioning its new-generation risk offering in the market, evident in the strong continued adoption of the Vitality-integrated
model over the period, with the Vitality Optimiser product comprising over 60% of all new business sales. The period also showed that overall claims for Vitality
Optimiser cases were 40% lower compared to non-Vitality Optimiser cases. Furthermore, VitalityLife received an award recognising the innovative nature of its
Interest Rate Optimiser product.


VitalityHealth

VitalityHealth experienced strong new business growth over the period, with new business up by 43% to R1,161 million in Rand terms (up 20% in GBP), with
particularly strong growth in the profitable Individual market - up by 44% - and direct-to-market channels, which now comprise almost 40% of new business.
The business also experienced an accelerated second half of the financial year, with new business up 62% and normalised profit up 55% in Rand terms for H2
2016 when compared to the same six-month period in the prior year. In addition, the existing book is profitable and generated strong cash flow, which in part
was used to fund the sizeable new business strain.

Both lapse rates and loss ratios trend in line with long-run expectation, reflecting the change in business mix and continued focus on quality within the
portfolio. Total insured lives grew by 5% over the period to June, with individual lives growing by 8.5%. The business also started to realise the benefit of the
extensive investment made following the exit of the Transitional Services Agreement (TSA) with Standard Life, with service levels and claims efficiency both
improving over the six-month period.

The combination of improved new business momentum, strong actuarial dynamics, and the emergence of operating efficiencies resulted in a 55%
improvement in Rand terms in operating profit for the second half of the year compared to the same period in the prior year. For the full year, profit was down
17% to R186 million (down 30% in GBP) as a result of the exceptional expenses incurred in the first half of the year related to the exit from the TSA.

Going forward, VitalityHealth expects new business momentum to be maintained, further efficiencies to emerge from the move to a single operating platform
and the benefit of the Healthcare Purchasing Alliance with Aviva to further support the loss ratio.

04 Record spend on new initiatives

1. South Africa

Discovery Insure

Discovery Insure showed strong new business growth in the second half of the year (up 14% to R439 million compared to the same period in the prior year),
resulting in a 7% growth to R841 million in new business volumes for the full-year period. This continues the trend of rapid new business growth experienced
since inception, with over 145,000 cars now covered and inforce growth of 36% to R2.2 billion. The business has achieved scale and quality and is expected to
be profitable in the next financial year.

The hybrid distribution model proved effective, showing growth of 30% for intermediated business for the year. Gross written premium increased year-on-year
by 39% to R1.6 billion, while total expenses grew 31% - a consequence of scale and increased penetration of the mobile app and sensor technology (50% of
new business). Claims frequency continued to decrease as the average policy duration increased and as a result of the Vitalitydrive model, which continues to
add tremendous value (engaged drivers showed a 28% lower loss ratio than unengaged drivers). This was offset to an extent by higher claims severity and
depreciation of the Rand against the US Dollar (which impacts the price of motor parts and hence repairs).


Intent to enter banking

Over the period, progress was made with respect to Discovery's intention to enter banking. The licensing and regulatory processes commenced and while the
licence application is pending regulatory approval, key engagements are underway with the South African Reserve Bank and other regulatory bodies. Discovery
has appointed a combination of senior seasoned bankers and Discovery executives to lead the execution and delivery of the banking business. Discovery is in
the process of building the system and infrastructure needed.


2. Discovery Partner Markets (DPM)

Discovery has evolved its Partner Market Strategy over time. From an initial joint venture with AIA, to a franchise model with partner insurers licencing Vitality
in their markets, to what can now be considered a Global Vitality Network. This comprises an international platform that is underpinned by a repeatable
business model - both economically and technologically; best-of breed global insurers and supply-side partners; the risk capacity and products to pioneer
shared-value insurance in its markets, owning this new category of insurance; and a powerful global repository of data on engagement, mortality and lapses.
Over the period, the efficacy of the model revealed itself through exciting new partnerships, launches in new territories with existing partners, and impressive
penetration levels in existing Partner Market territories.

AIA Vitality

The period was noteworthy for AIA Vitality, with the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model now part of the core offering in six AIA markets: Singapore, Australia,
Hong Kong, Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. The response to the launch of Vitality has been positive with significant media coverage, brand awareness and
agent engagement; and encouraging performance in the more established AIA territories. The take-up rate on eligible products is greater than 50% in Hong
Kong and Singapore while a strong positive take-up is seen in Australia. As the business gains traction, plans are to extend the range of insurance products that
integrate with Vitality in these markets.

John Hancock Vitality and Manulife Vitality

John Hancock Vitality continues to see very strong adoption rates and high initial customer engagement in its second year on the market. The Protection
Universal Life, Term, and Indexed Universal Life products are available in the majority of states, and the remaining states are expected to help drive sales, once
approved. Since launch, John Hancock Vitality has received numerous awards and garnered significant media attention for its innovative and transformative
approach to life insurance.

Manulife Vitality is anticipated to launch in September, pioneering the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model in Canada.

Generali Vitality

Generali Vitality launched to the public in Germany in June 2016 with the first sales occurring in July. The initial market response has been exceptional, with
new business doubling the run-rate leading up to launch. The media response has also been overwhelmingly positive. The business intends to launch in France
on 1 January 2017, followed shortly in Austria.


Ping An Health

The business's impressive performance continued with new business sales of RMB151 million and RMB595 million in the Group and Individual segments for
the full year period. This represented an overall increase of 27% for Group and 50% for Individual sales on the corresponding period in the prior financial year.
Business fundamentals also remained strong, with lapses within expectation, and loss ratios on Individual business better than expected. The number of health
insurance lives covered increased by 33% over the past 12-month period from 418,000 at June 2015 to 555,000 at June 2016.

Healthcare reform has been identified as a key focus in the Chinese government's new five-year plan, with State spending under pressure. Ping An has
identified healthcare as a key strategic investment for the Group. In line with this, Ping An Health has undergone a major management restructure with the
appointment of highly-qualified and experienced leadership to position the business for growth in the coming years.


05 Prospects for growth

Discovery is currently well capitalised to fund its growth ambitions and has buffers to withstand potential adverse experience, while safeguarding future
earnings and maintaining acceptable levels of debt. Given the quantum of growth opportunities facing the Group, however, this plan is carefully and
systematically reviewed and updated. Discovery foresees continued strong performance from existing businesses going forward; and spend on new initiatives
to reduce over time, absent of the intent to enter banking. This combination positions Discovery for continued growth in the future.

Fair value hierarchy of financial instruments

The Group's financial instruments measured at fair value have been disclosed using a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy has three levels that reflect the
significance of the inputs used in measuring fair value. These are as follows:

Level 1 includes financial instruments that are measured using unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for identical financial instruments. Quoted prices
are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and
regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.

Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data. Instruments in this category are valued
using:

(a) quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which are not considered to be active or

(b) valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.

Level 3 includes financial instruments that are valued using valuation techniques that incorporate information other than observable market data and where at
least one input (which could have a significant effect on instruments' valuation) cannot be based on observable market data.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments in level 2

- Discovery has invested in equity linked notes offered by international banks in order to back certain unit-linked contract liabilities. The calculation of the daily
  value of the equity linked investments is made by the provider of the note. Discovery has procedures in place to ensure that these prices are correct. Aside
  from the daily reasonableness checks versus similar funds and movement since the prior day's price, the fund values are calculated with reference to a
  specific formula or index, disclosed to the policyholders, which is recalculated by Discovery in order to check if the price provided by the provider is correct.

- If a quoted market price is not available on a recognised stock exchange or from a broker for non-exchange traded financial instruments, the fair value of the
  instrument is estimated by the asset managers, using valuation techniques including the use of recent arm's length market transactions, reference to the
  current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow techniques, option pricing models or other valuation techniques
  that provide a reliable estimate of prices obtained in actual market transactions.

- The fair value of the hedged derivatives is calculated by the issuers of those instruments, as follows:

 (a) The fair value of call options is calculated on a Black-Scholes model.

 (b) The fair value of the return swaps is calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the instruments.

 (c) The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.

1 The inter-segment funding of R452 million reflects a notional allocation of interest earned on the negative reserve backing policyholders' funds of guaranteed investment products and hence is transferred to Discovery Invest.
  The segment information is presented on the same basis as reported to the Chief Executive Officers of the reportable segments. The segment total is then adjusted for accounting reclassifications and entries required to produce IFRS compliant results. These adjustments include the following:
2 The VitalityLife results are reclassified to account for the contractual arrangement in respect of the business written on the statement of financial position of Prudential Assurance Company Limited, as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4.
3 The Discovery Unit Trusts (DUT) are consolidated into Discovery's results for IFRS purposes. In the Segment information the DUT column includes the effects of consolidating the unit trusts into Discovery's results, effectively being the income and expenses relating to units held by third parties.
4 Investment income earned on assets backing policyholder liabilities is included as part of the normalised profit from operations in the segmental disclosure, but is included together with shareholder investment income for IFRS purposes.

1 The inter-segment funding of R457 million reflects a notional allocation of interest earned on the negative reserve backing policyholders' funds of guaranteed investment products and hence is transferred to Discovery Invest.
  The segment information is presented on the same basis as reported to the Chief Executive Officers of the reportable segments. The segment total is then adjusted for accounting reclassifications and entries required to produce IFRS compliant results. These adjustments include the following:
2 The VitalityLife results are reclassified to account for the contractual arrangement in respect of the business written on the statement of financial position of Prudential Assurance Company Limited, as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4.
3 The Discovery Unit Trusts (DUT) are consolidated into Discovery's results for IFRS purposes. In the Segment information the DUT column includes the effects of consolidating the unit trusts into Discovery's results, effectively being the income and expenses relating to units held by third parties.
4 Investment income earned on assets backing policyholder liabilities is included as part of the normalised profit from operations in the segmental disclosure, but is included together with shareholder investment income for IFRS purposes.
5 Change in presentation
  At each reporting date, Discovery must review whether the segments being disclosed still comply with IFRS8-Segment reporting. Based on this review, the operating segments that were previously reported in the ""New Business Development"" segment no longer meet the aggregation criteria. As they do not meet
  the quantitative thresholds either, they have moved to the ""All other segments"" column. Comparative disclosure has been updated to be consistent with the current year disclosure. New business development previously included The Vitality Group in the United States of America, Ping An Health in China, AIA
  Vitality in Asia and Discovery Insure in South Africa, as well as expenses incurred to investigate new products and markets.

New business API is calculated at 12 times the monthly premium for new recurring premium policies and 10% of the value of new single premium policies. It
also includes both automatic premium increases and servicing increases on existing policies.

The new business API in the table above differs from the new business API disclosed in the embedded value largely as a result of:
- The timing of inclusion of policyholders in the calculation of new business API. In the embedded value, new business is included from the earlier of the date
  that the first premium has been received or when the policy is on risk, whereas in the table above, new business is included when the policy has been
  contractually committed.
- Inclusion of automatic premium increases and servicing increases on existing life policies. These are excluded in the embedded value, but included in the
  table above.

For The Vitality Group and Ping An Health, the embedded value definition of new business is used in the table above.

Refer to the footnotes to Table 7: Embedded Value of New Business for a more detailed description of the differences in new business disclosures between the
Embedded Value and the table above.

Significant transactions affecting the current results

Increase in the DiscoveryCard profit share arrangement

Prior to 1 July 2015, Discovery and FirstRand Bank Limited (FRB) had a joint arrangement in place that makes a ""Discovery"" branded FNB credit card
(DiscoveryCard) available to the clients of Discovery. In terms of this arrangement, FRB paid Discovery an amount equal to 20% of the profits generated by the
DiscoveryCard.

During the current year, both parties agreed that Discovery will increase its economic interest in the DiscoveryCard by subscribing for redeemable preference
shares in the share capital of FRB. This entitles Discovery to receive an additional 54.99% of the profits generated by the DiscoveryCard effective from 1 July
2015. In December 2015, Discovery subscribed for R1.4 billion FRB redeemable preference shares and in April 2016 the contractual rights under the preference
shares were finalised.

In terms of IAS 38: Intangible Assets, the preference shares have been disclosed as an intangible asset in the Statement of financial position as the substance of
the arrangement is a right to receive additional 54.99% of the profits generated by the DiscoveryCard. This intangible asset will be amortised through profit or
loss as profits are expected to emerge and R26 million has been recognised for the current financial year. This has been added back in the calculation of
Normalised Headline Earnings. At 30 June 2016, there was no indication of impairment.

R121 million is receivable in respect of the 54.99% profits generated by the DiscoveryCard from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016. As the contractual rights under the
preference shares were only finalised in April 2016, any profits earned prior to that, being R86 million, represents an adjustment to the purchase price of the
intangible asset rather than income received and as such has reduced the value of the intangible asset recognised. This has been added to Normalised
Headline Earnings.


Increase in borrowings

United Kingdom borrowings

During the year ended 30 June 2015, Discovery entered into a GBP 100 million term facility with HSBC Bank Plc which will be used to fund the operations of
VitalityLife. At 30 June 2015, GBP 26.4 million of the facility was utilised. During the current financial year, the remaining balance of GBP 73.6 million was
utilised. In addition, a new facility of GBP 50 million was entered into during the current financial year, of which GBP 20 million was utilised by year-end.
Discovery repaid GBP 7.5 million (R173 million) of the original facility on 31 May 2016, as per the agreed terms. The balance owing to HSBC Bank Plc at year-end
was R2 226 million (2015: R506 million). The increase in these borrowings is partially offset by a reduction in Negative reserve funding, outlined in more detail
on the next page.

Finance charges of R60 million in respect of these borrowings have been recognised in profit or loss.

South African borrowings

Discovery concluded a bank syndicated loan programme in June 2016, whereby the existing RMB term loan of R400 million entered into in 2010, which was due
to mature in September 2017, and a bridge loan facility of R2.6 billion entered into in December 2015, were refinanced through the following long-term
facilities:

- A fixed rate term loan facility of R1.6 billion has been entered into with Rand Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited. The facility has the
  following profile:
  - R500 million at a fixed interest rate of 10.79% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, with capital repayable on 10 June 2021.
  - R1.1 billion at a fixed interest rate of 10.44% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, with an amortising capital profile, having the first repayment on
    10 June 2019 and final settlement on 10 June 2021.
- A subsidiary in the Discovery Group issued 1 400 A preference shares at an issue price of R1 million each, by way of private placement to Investec Bank
  Limited. The preference shares were issued at a fixed coupon rate of 8.015% per annum, paid bi-annually. The shares are cumulative, non-participating,
  non-convertible preference shares and redeemable on 29 June 2021.

 Since the shares are mandatorily redeemable on a specified date, they have been recognised as Borrowings in the Statement of Financial Position. The value
 of the preference shares has been reduced by share issue costs of R6.7 million. As the dividends are cumulative, they have been accrued for in the current
 financial year and disclosed in finance costs in profit or loss.

Finance charges of R155 million in respect of these South African borrowings have been recognised in profit or loss.



Negative reserve funding

The negative reserve funding liability on Discovery's Statement of financial position represents the acquisition costs that are funded by Prudential on behalf of
VitalityLife. The liability unwinds and is repaid on a matched basis as the cash flows emerge from the assets arising from insurance contracts. In the event that
the cash flows do not emerge as anticipated, VitalityLife would be required to repay these liabilities from other resources.

The decrease in the negative reserve funding liability relates to the repayment of funding by VitalityLife in the current financial year.

Refinancing of BEE transaction by a BEE partner

In September 2005, Discovery concluded a BEE transaction pursuant to which 38 725 909 shares were issued to a consortium of BEE parties. 14 226 181 of
these shares were issued to the Discovery Foundation (The Foundation) being one of the BEE consortium members, at R0.001 each, for an initial period of
10 years (initial period).

The difference between the market value of the ordinary shares issued to the BEE parties and the subscription consideration, represented an outstanding
funded amount provided by Discovery shareholders (funded amount). These shares were treated as treasury shares.

At the end of the initial period,
- Discovery had the right to repurchase such number of ordinary shares at R0.001 per share that would provide Discovery with a notional return of the funded
  amount.
- In order for The Foundation to retain the full number of Discovery shares originally issued to them, The Foundation then had the right to simultaneously
  acquire from Discovery, at the then thirty-day volume-weighted average price (VWAP) per Discovery share, the same number of shares repurchased by
  Discovery.

The initial period expired in December 2015 and resulted in the following transactions:
- Discovery repurchased 5 666 134 Discovery shares held by The Foundation at a price of R0.001 per Discovery share.
- The issue to The Foundation by Discovery of 5 666 134 new Discovery shares at a price of R144.22 per Discovery share (representing the 30 day VWAP to
  9 December 2015). This increased Share Capital and Share Premium by R817.2 million.

Treasury shares have therefore decreased by 14 226 181.

Consolidation of Discovery Unit Trusts

The Discovery Unit Trusts are consolidated into Discovery's results in both the current and prior financial year. The following large increases in the Discovery
Unit Trusts Statement of financial position have had a direct impact on the Group's Statement of financial position:
- Cash and cash equivalents increased by R510 million.
- Loans and receivables increased by R545 million.
- Trade and other payables increased by R1 525 million.
- Investments at fair value through profit or loss increased by R9 203 million.
- Investment contracts at fair value through profit or loss increased by R8 726 million.


Other significant items in these results

Taxation

For South African entities that are in a tax paying position, tax has been provided at 28% (2015: 28%) in the financial statements. No deferred tax assets have
been recognised on the assessed losses in Discovery Insure and The Vitality Group.

At 30 June 2015, a deferred tax asset of R295 million was raised in respect of the VitalityHealth assessed losses. This approximated 50% of the potential
deferred tax asset and was based on forecast taxable income for the next five years. No further asset has been raised in the current results.

Material transactions with related parties

Discovery Health administers the Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) and provides managed care services for which it charges an administration fee and
a managed healthcare fee respectively. These fees are determined on an annual basis and approved by the trustees of DHMS. The fees totalled R4 711 million
for the year ended 30 June 2016 (2015: R4 374 million). Discovery offers the members of DHMS access to the Vitality programme.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss have increased by R10.8 billion due to the sale of Discovery Invest products. This includes the impact of
consolidating the Discovery Unit Trusts into the Group's results. The increase in the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss has been presented in
‘Net purchase of investments held to back policyholder liabilities' of R9 597 million in the Statement of cash flows.

Deferred tax liability

The deferred tax liability is primarily attributable to the application of the Financial Services Board directive 145. This directive allows for the zeroing on a
statutory basis of the assets arising from insurance contracts. The statutory basis is used when calculating tax payable for Discovery Life, resulting in a timing
difference between the tax base and the accounting base.

The future basis for taxation of Life companies is currently being reviewed by National Treasury.

Accounting policies

The Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards including IAS 34, as well as the South
African Companies Act 71 of 2008. The accounting policies adopted are consistent with the accounting policies applied in the prior Annual Financial Statements.


Change in comparatives

When Discovery Life launched the Discovery Retirement Optimiser, it sold it as an add-on to the Discovery Life Plan. As the Discovery Life Plan (DLP) and the
Discovery Retirement Optimiser (DRO) were covered under one policy, the insurance liabilities for both these portions of the policy were therefore disclosed
together in the Statement of financial position. The DLP portion would result in an insurance asset and the DRO portion would result in an insurance liability.
The net value would be disclosed in Assets arising from insurance contracts.

Following the launch of Discovery Invest the DRO product and the administration system were restructured over time. The single policy referred to above, was
eventually split into two policies and the policyholder now had a DLP policy and a DRO policy. Either policy could now be cancelled individually. From that date,
the insurance asset for the DLP policy and the insurance liability for the DRO policy should have been disclosed separately, but has not been given the gradual
evolution of the DRO product and processes. The historic practice was reconsidered in the current financial year and disclosure in both the current and prior
year Statement of financial positions have been updated to disclose the insurance asset and insurance liability separately.

The restatement to the comparative Statement of financial position results in an increase of R6 418 million to Assets arising from insurance contracts and a
corresponding equal increase in the Liabilities arising from insurance contracts. The restatement has no impact on the Group's comparative net profit, nor the
Group's comparative basic and diluted earnings per share, nor the Group's comparative cash flows.

Audit

The consolidated financial statements are considered preliminary based on the JSE Listings Requirements and are summarised from a complete set of the
Group financial statements on which the Independent Auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., have expressed an unqualified audit opinion, which is available
for inspection at the Company's registered office.

This report is extracted from audited information, but is not itself audited. The Auditor's Report does not necessarily report on all of the information contained
in this announcement. Shareholders are therefore advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditor's engagement they should
obtain a copy of the Auditor's Report together with the accompanying financial information from the Company's registered office.

The directors of Discovery take full responsibility for the preparation of this report and that the financial information has been correctly extracted from the
underlying Annual Financial Statements.

A copy of the Annual Financial Statements that have been summarised in this report can be obtained from the Company's registered office.



Embedded value statement
for the twelve months ended 30 June 2016


The embedded value of Discovery consists of the following components:

- the free surplus attributed to the business at the valuation date;
- plus: the required capital to support the in-force covered business at the valuation date;
- plus: the present value of expected future shareholder cash flows from the in-force covered business;
- less: the cost of required capital.

The present value of future shareholder cash flows from the in-force covered business is calculated as the value of projected future after-tax shareholder cash
flows of the business in-force at the valuation date, discounted at the risk discount rate.

The value of new business is the present value, at the point of sale, of the projected future after-tax shareholder cash flows of the new business written by
Discovery, discounted at the risk discount rate, less an allowance for the reserving strain, initial expenses and cost of required capital. The value of new
business is calculated using the current reporting date assumptions.

For Life, the shareholder cash flows are based on the release of margins under the Statutory Valuation Method (""SVM"") basis.

The embedded value includes the insurance and administration profits of the covered business in the Discovery Limited group. Covered business includes
business written in South Africa through Discovery Life, Discovery Invest, Discovery Health and Discovery Vitality, and in the United Kingdom through VitalityLife
and VitalityHealth. For The Vitality Group (USA), Ping An Health and Discovery Insure, no published value has been placed on the current in-force business as
the businesses have not yet reached suitable scale with predictable experience.

In August 2011, Discovery raised R800 million through the issue of non-cumulative, non-participating, non-convertible preference shares. For embedded value
purposes this capital, net of share issue expenses, has been excluded from the adjusted net worth.

In November 2014, the Prudential Assurance Company (Prudential) agreed to sell its remaining 25% shareholding in Prudential Health Holdings Limited (PHHL)
to Discovery Limited for GBP 155 million (R2 790 million). Following the purchase of the remaining 25% in PHHL, PruHealth and PruProtect have been
rebranded as VitalityHealth and VitalityLife respectively.

In June 2015, the methodology to derive the assumed beta was amended. Under this revised methodology, the assumed beta is set with reference to the
observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time period and with reference to the ALSI. The resulting assumed beta is then fixed at this level unless
the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time period departs significantly from this assumption at the financial year end. At 30 June 2016
the observed beta has departed materially from the previous assumption, resulting in a change to the beta assumption. The beta assumption used at 30 June
2016 is 0.75 (30 June 2015: 0.55).

In December 2015, the initial period expired on the BEE transaction that was concluded in September 2005 with the Discovery Foundation. In the transaction,
shares were issued to the Discovery Foundation at R0.001 per share for an initial period of 10 years. At the end of this initial period Discovery has the right to
repurchase these ordinary shares at R0.001 per share which would provide Discovery with the notional return of the funded amount. Simultaneously, the
Discovery Foundation has the right to acquire from Discovery the same number of shares repurchased by Discovery. At the expiry of the initial period, the
above transactions were executed resulting in an increased share capital and premium of R817 million and a decrease of 14 226 181 treasury shares.

In January 2016, the European insurance regulation Solvency II came into effect and Vitality Life Limited was granted a life insurance licence in the United
Kingdom on which it commenced writing new business. These two changes required that the embedded value methodology for VitalityLife be reviewed. The
key methodology change was the zeroisation of the negative reserves emerging under insurance contracts in Vitality Life Limited and Discovery funded
VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence. This effectively moves the negative reserve from net worth to the value of in-force. The value of negative reserves
under insurance contracts that were set to zero at 30 June 2016 was R3.1 billion.

In June 2016, the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum voted in favour of the United Kingdom departing from the European Union. This
event, coined ""Brexit"", resulted in economic environmental impacts for VitalityHealth and VitalityLife. The embedded value calculation at 30 June 2016 includes
the impacts of lower UK risk-free rates and depreciation of the British Pound relative to the South African Rand.

The 30 June 2016 embedded value results and disclosures were subjected to an external review.

  R1 353 million (June 2015: R935 million). For Life, the required capital was set equal to two times the statutory Capital Adequacy Requirement. For Health
  and Vitality, the required capital was set equal to two times the monthly renewal expense and Vitality benefit cost. For VitalityHealth, the required capital
  amount was set equal to 1.4 times the Solvency II Pillar 1 Solvency Capital Requirement. For the VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence, the required
  capital was set equal to the UK Solvency I long term insurance capital requirement as per the agreement with Prudential. For the business sold on the
  Vitality Life Limited licence, the required capital was set equal to the excess of 1.4 times the Solvency II Pillar 1 Solvency Capital Requirement over the
  negative Solvency II technical provisions.

  PrimeMed acquisition.
3 This item represents the difference between the purchase price and the minority share of PHHL's tangible net asset value at the acquisition
  date plus 25% of the value in-force and cost of required capital that Discovery purchased in the transaction at the acquisition date.
4 This item reflects the unwinding of the goodwill and intangible assets (net of deferred tax) relating to the acquisition of Standard Life
  Healthcare and the Prudential joint venture allocated to minorities.

  International, once-off expenses in Invest, Discovery Insure, other new business initiatives and unallocated head office costs.
6 This item includes rebranding costs, as well as other once-off costs relating to the acquisition of 25% of PHHL.
7 Acquisition costs relate to commission paid on Life business and expenses incurred in writing Health and Vitality business that has been
  written over the period but will only be activated and on risk after the valuation date. These policies are not included in the embedded
  value or the value of new business and therefore the costs are excluded.
8 This item includes the tax benefit that will be obtained as the VitalityHealth DAC and intangible software assets amortise.
9 The return on shareholders' funds is shown net of tax and management charges.

1 Policy alterations relate to changes to existing benefits at the request of the policyholder.
2 The tax variance for Life and Invest arises due to a movement in the deferred tax asset which delays the payment of tax.
3 The projection term for Health and Vitality, Group Life and VitalityHealth at 30 June 2016 has not been changed from that used in the
  30 June 2015 embedded value calculation. Therefore, an experience variance arises because the total term of the in-force covered business
  is effectively increased by twelve months.

1 For VitalityLife, the key modelling change relates to the zeroisation of the intangible negative reserves for Vitality Life Limited and Discovery
  funded VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence to reflect the shareholder cash flows on these policies. This effectively moves the
  negative reserve from net worth to the value of in-force.
2 The economic assumption changes include the following items:
  - A change in the beta coefficient from 0.55 at 30 June 2015 to 0.75 at 30 June 2016.
  - For Health and Vitality and Discovery Life, there has been an increase in the South African risk-free rate since 30 June 2015.
  - For VitalityHealth and VitalityLife, there has been a reduction in the UK risk-free rate since 30 June 2015.
  - For VitalityLife, there is a realised loss in the net worth relating to the whole of life reinsurance structure.
3 For Life and VitalityHealth, the reinsurance item primarily relates to the impact of the financing reinsurance arrangements.
4 For VitalityLife, the other item relates to the margin reset as per the accounting policy.

1 The United Kingdom Corporation tax rate assumed is 20% in 2016 to 2017, 19% in 2018 to 2020, and 18% beyond that.

The Discovery Limited embedded value is calculated based on a risk discount rate using the CAPM approach with specific reference to the Discovery beta
coefficient. The assumed beta is set with reference to the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time period. The beta is calculated with
reference to the ALSI. The resulting assumed beta will be fixed at this level unless the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time period
departs significantly from this assumption at the financial year end. At 30 June 2016 the observed beta had departed materially from the assumption, resulting
in a change to the beta assumption. The beta assumption used at 30 June 2016 is 0.75 (30 June 2015: 0.55). As beta values reflect the historic performance of
share prices relative to the market they may not allow fully for non-market related and non-financial risk. Investors may want to form their own view on an
appropriate allowance for these risks which have not been modelled explicitly.

Life and Invest mortality, morbidity and lapse and surrender assumptions were derived from internal experience, where available, augmented by reinsurance
and industry information.

The Health and Vitality lapse assumptions were derived from the results of recent experience investigations.

The VitalityHealth assumptions were derived from internal experience, augmented by industry information.

VitalityLife assumptions were derived from internal experience, where available, augmented by reinsurance, industry and Discovery Limited group information.

Renewal expense assumptions were based on the results of the latest expense and budget information.

The initial expenses included in the calculation of the embedded value of new business are the actual costs incurred excluding expenses of an exceptional or
non-recurring nature.

The South African investment return assumption was based on a single interest rate derived from the risk-free zero coupon government bond yield curve.
Other economic assumptions were set relative to this yield. The current and projected tax position of the policyholder funds within the Life company has been
taken into account in determining the net investment return assumption.

The best estimate investment return assumption for VitalityHealth and VitalityLife was based on the single interest rate derived from the risk-free zero coupon
sterling yield curve. The United Kingdom expense inflation assumption was set in line with long-term United Kingdom inflation expectations.

It is assumed that, for the purposes of calculating the cost of required capital, the Life and Invest required capital amount will be backed by surplus assets
consisting of 100% equities and the Health, Vitality, VitalityHealth and Vitality Life Limited required capital amounts will be fully backed by cash. The VitalityLife
business on the Prudential licence required capital amount is assumed to earn the same return as the assets backing the VitalityLife policyholder liabilities.
Allowance has been made for tax and investment expenses in the calculation of the cost of required capital. In calculating the capital gains tax liability, it is
assumed that the portfolio is realised every 5 years. The Life and Invest cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the gross of tax
equity return and the equity return net of tax and expenses. The Health, Vitality, VitalityHealth and Vitality Life Limited cost of required capital is calculated
using the difference between the risk discount rate and the net of tax cash return. The VitalityLife business on the Prudential licence cost of required capital is
calculated using the difference between the risk discount rate and the net of tax asset return assumption.



Sensitivity to the embedded value assumptions

The embedded value has been calculated in accordance with the Actuarial Society of South Africa's Advisory Practice Note APN 107: Embedded Value Reporting. The risk discount rate, calculated in accordance with the practice note,
uses the CAPM approach with specific reference to the Discovery beta coefficient. As beta values reflect the historic performance of share prices relative to the market they may not allow fully for non-market related and non-financial
risk. Investors may want to form their own view on an appropriate allowance for these risks which have not been modelled explicitly. The sensitivity of the embedded value and the embedded value of new business at 30 June 2016 to
changes in the risk discount rate is included in the tables below.

For each sensitivity illustrated below, all other assumptions have been left unchanged. No allowance has been made for management action such as risk premium increases where future experience is worse than the base assumptions.

TRADING STATEMENT: YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 
 
Shareholders are advised that normalised profit from operations is expected to increase by between 
10% and 15%  and normalised headline earnings is expected to increase by between 5% and 10% for the 
year ended 30 June 2016 (“current period”). Discovery’s results have been affected by an increased 
investment in new initiatives, including the takeon of the Bankmed medical scheme administration and 
managed care contract, the investment in the planned expansion of the business model into banking, 
the buying up of Discovery’s economic interest in the DiscoveryCard and increased costs arising from 
growth in Ping An Health and other International Partner Markets. 
          
Normalised headline earnings per share for the current period is impacted by the increase in total shares 
in issue, following implementation of the Rights Issue in April 2015. 
 
Headline earnings per share and basic earnings per share for the year ended 30 June 2015 (“prior 
period”) were positively impacted by the accounting treatment resulting from the once-off lapsing of 
the put options Prudential held in respect of its interest in the UK joint venture – this was due to 
Discovery’s purchase of the Prudential’s remaining 25% of the joint venture in November 2014. As this 
once-off increase in profits occurred during the prior period, all current period comparatives with the 
2015 financial year will be affected, as previously advised in the results announcement for the year 
ended 30 June 2015 released on the Stock Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 10 September 2015.  
 
Shareholders are advised of the following guidance on undiluted earnings per share for the current 
period: 
       - Normalised headline earnings per share is expected to increase in the range between 0% to 5%, 
         to between 672.2 cents and 705.8 cents over the prior period (2015: 672.2 cents); 
       - Headline earnings per share is expected to decrease in the range of 30% to 40%, to between 
         617.7 cents and 529.4 cents over the prior period (2015: 882.4 cents); and 
       - Earnings per share is expected to decrease in the range of 30% to 40%, to between 640.4 cents 
         and 548.9 cents (2015: 914.8 cents). 
 
Normalised profit from operations is expected to increase in the range of 10% to 15%, to between R6 
368 million and R6 657 million over the prior period (2015: R5 789m). 
 
Discovery’s results for the current period are due to be released on SENS on 6 September 2016. 
 
The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported

Commentary

01 | Group Financial Performance

The six-month period ended 31 December 2015 saw a robust financial performance, accompanied by significant investment in new initiatives.

At a Group level, new business displayed excellent growth of 27% to R8 435 million, above the 10-year compound annual growth rate of 15%.

From an earnings perspective, headline earnings in the prior year were positively impacted by the once-off accounting treatment resulting from the
lapsing of the put options Prudential held in respect of its interest in the UK joint venture - this was due to Discovery's purchase of Prudential's remaining
25% of the joint venture in November 2014. As a result, earnings per share decreased by 53% to 281.0 cents per share.

Normalised profit from operations increased 7% to R3 015 million; and normalised headline earnings were up 7% to R2 124 million, a growth rate lower
than Discovery's historic rate due to:

1.   An accelerated and substantial investment in new initiatives in excess of 60% over the prior period, including the banking initiative; Ping An Health;
     Discovery Partner Markets and further development of the Vitality Network; the take-on of the Bankmed Medical Scheme; and refining the underlying
     Vitality Chassis, manifesting in the SA launch of the global product, Vitality Active Rewards with Apple Watch.

2.   Higher-than-expected costs associated with moving VitalityHealth in the UK onto its own system infrastructure.

Finally, embedded value grew 24% to R56.5 billion, despite a rising interest rate and currency depreciation; and return on average equity was 13%.

This performance takes place amidst an environment of considerable volatility, with increasing interest rates, a depreciating currency and weak equity
market sentiment. Given the prudent way the Discovery Group has been structured, for example, through geographic and industry diversification and
product design that links to economic factors and accurately matches price to risk, the Group remains resilient in the face of economic and non-economic
stresses in terms of its earnings, embedded value and solvency position.

Consistent with its dividend policy, Discovery declared an increase in total dividends payable of 10%. Given the change in the number of shares, this
results in a gross dividend per share of 85.5 cents, flat on the prior year, though in line with the growth in normalised headline earnings per share. This
will allow Discovery the flexibility to continue to invest for future growth.


02 | Strategic Overview

Considerable work was done over the period to refine the business model, resulting in a disciplined and scalable shared-value model aligned to
Discovery's core purpose and consistent with emerging trends, including the increasingly behavioural nature of insurance risk; the rise of technology as an
enabler of accurate risk segmentation; and the growing social responsibility of insurers to make people healthier. The output is twofold:

1)   better value for money, social outcomes, and actuarial performance; and

2)   the imperative for organic growth.

Discovery has thus developed a growth engine where significant investment is made in new businesses - between 8% and 10% of earnings historically, and
in excess of this over the period - to develop them into emerging businesses that exhibit strong new business and operating profit growth, and over time,
become incumbents that track well above economic growth. This philosophy of sustainable, organic growth was evident over the period in, for example,
Discovery Insure, which is now at the inflection point of becoming an emerging business; and Discovery Partner Markets, which is still fairly young in
maturity but promises significant potential earnings with low levels of capital deployed.

Furthermore, underpinning the business model is continual investment in the science of the model and the Vitality chassis. Building on the success of the
UK launch of Vitality Active Rewards, the South African launch of Vitality Active Rewards with Apple Watch saw unprecedented success. To date, the
take-up and engagement levels in SA have been exceptional - over 160 000 members have joined the programme, with significant behaviour change
illustrated by an increase of 21% in physical activity events per week. This makes it the most successful Vitality benefit launched to date. The nature of the
UK (Active Rewards) and South African (Active Rewards with Apple Watch) experience is encouraging for the global business, given the planned roll-outs of
Vitality Active Rewards with Apple Watch in Discovery's other territories over the course of 2016.

The focus on the Group's capital structure, to support both new initiatives and growth within established businesses, continued during the six months
under review. The period included both the impact of additional financial reinsurance taken out in November 2014 by Discovery Life to support Group
expansion, and the Rights Issue in March 2015 of R5 billion. The capital raised through the Rights Issue was allocated to the purchase of another 54.99%
share in the DiscoveryCard, as well as to capitalise the UK business and provide the capital foundation for Discovery's banking aspirations.


03 | Business-specific Performance

3.1 South Africa

Discovery Health

Discovery Health performed better than expectation. During the period, normalised operating profit increased by 11% to R1 061 million. In addition, new
business API (excluding Bankmed, which reflected in new business in the prior period) increased off a significant base by 36% to R3 826 million.

The period under review also saw the impact of Discovery Health's innovation and expertise on the sustained excellent performance of the Discovery
Health Medical Scheme: lives administered grew by 2.2% to 2.7 million; and the solvency ratio remained above the statutory 25% - with reserves higher
than the next 10 open schemes combined.

Discovery Health continued to build strategic assets across the healthcare system to generate savings for its medical scheme clients, and efficiencies
within administration. An example is its direct delivery service for medicines (SouthernRx), and Discovery HomeCare, both of which are saving significant
amounts for Discovery Health's scheme clients, while improving the quality of care received by members.

Discovery Health continued its strategic move towards digital healthcare. Over the period, the Discovery Health Medical Scheme launched the country's
first fully-digital healthcare plan - the Smart Plan. The Smart Plan has proven successful in attracting a younger demographic, and demonstrates the lowest
premium per unit of benefit in the market - a result of its advanced analytical backbone that optimises healthcare network utilisation by matching member
supply and demand in real-time.

Furthermore, the focused investment in the administration platform, in preparation for Bankmed (representing over 200 000 new members from
1 January 2016), laid the foundation for the attraction of two significant new restricted scheme clients, which are scheduled to join on 1 July 2016,
continuing Discovery Health's significant success in the restricted scheme market.

Discovery Health strongly supports the objectives of universal health coverage that underpin the NHI White Paper and will work closely with the
Department of Health and all other stakeholders on the details of the proposal, and assist with implementation where possible. Discovery Health is also
actively participating in the Health Market Inquiry of the Competition Commission.


Discovery Life

Discovery Life's performance was robust with excellent market share growth overall (28% of new business share this year versus 26% last year). Earnings
were 13% higher (pre-FinRe) than the prior period, with normalised operating profit growing 13% to R1 658 million, reversing out the impact of additional
cash FinRe from November 2014. Lapse rates demonstrated an improving trend and the claims experience was in line with long-term expectation.
Experience variances were positive excluding economic variances. The business generated R187 million in cash over the period (pre-FinRe and
repayments), with the cash position remaining strong with CAR cover unchanged at 3.9 times.

The period was notable for Discovery Life's continued investment in building a strong and sophisticated adviser force. The large tied adviser force
exhibited productivity levels 200% above that of the market. This also led to the development of the Discovery Financial Adviser Academy, aimed at
training and accelerating the entrance of new tied advisers into the insurance market.

At the same time, the impact of the Discovery business model is evident. An analysis of the dynamic pricing structure shows that when comparing the
transition of integrated versus non-integrated cohorts over time - the integrated cohort is superior from a retention and health profile perspective.


Discovery Invest

The performance of Discovery Invest was excellent with new business year-on-year growth of 17%, assets under management exceeding R56 billion and
operating profit growth of 25% to R238 million. Invest new business margins improved through product innovation.

During the period under review, the business continued to drive innovation by launching pre-retirement accumulation products and linked annuities in
retirement, that pivot off the shared-value model. Given the scientific evidence of Vitality improving mortality and morbidity, there is a genuine need for
additional retirement savings to cater for extended lifespans. Using the shared-value model, and underpinned by Vitality, these products create higher
retirement benefits, larger income in retirement and longer-lasting retirement assets through increased longevity.


Discovery Insure

Over the period, Discovery Insure continued its progression towards meeting the criteria of a Discovery business, namely: insurgency and market
leadership in new business, driven by superior products that drive engagement and improve actuarial dynamics, and existing within an exceptional service
ecosystem. New business was maintained at the high base set in the prior period, with an increased focus on quality; and growth was witnessed in gross
written premiums and cumulative inforce policies. In addition, the profit signature continued its trend towards breakeven.

More importantly, the period saw the business deliver on the key drivers of value - selection and behaviour change; and durational impact. The
Vitalitydrive model continued to deliver superior actuarial dynamics: risk profile varied by Vitalitydrive status, and initial indications of sustained behaviour
change were witnessed by a 14% improvement in driving scores after seven months using the smartphone app and sensor technology. Furthermore,
analysis done on Discovery Insure clients compared to the industry, revealed that Insure clients have a better risk profile by claims experience - by a
minimum of 19% as derived by comparing the cause of an accident between Insure drivers and other third party drivers. In addition, continued evidence
exists for the loss ratio improving by duration.

Finally, Discovery Insure remains focused on its pioneering technology in terms of claims and telematics. During the period, recognition included winning
the ""Most Innovative New Digital Product"" at the Gartner Annual symposium in Barcelona in November 2015.


3.2 The United Kingdom

The UK business is a fundamental beachhead for Discovery's strategy of internationalising its composite Health and Life insurance model, given the UK's
lifestyle disease burden, aging population, sizeable protection market and commoditised offerings. Against this backdrop, the business is now established
- VitalityLife was granted its own life insurance licence in December 2015; VitalityHealth has transitioned to its own systems chassis, off that of Standard
Life Healthcare; the branding strategy for the combined business is now paying dividends in terms of brand recall and social presence; the business is now
capitalised; and an integrated Health and Life Vitality platform has been successfully developed, evidenced by the success of Active Rewards.


VitalityLife

From a financial perspective, VitalityLife produced an excellent six-month performance, with new business sales up 28% in Rand terms (R643 million vs
R502 million). This resulted in a 28% increase in normalised profit (R343 million vs R269 million) over the period. VitalityLife is currently in third position in
the IFA sector with a market share of 11.3%. VitalityLife's distribution footprint continued to grow significantly with the 18 active Franchises accounting for
72% of all new business sales over the period, and the single ties channel growing to 23 as at December 2015.

During the period under review, VitalityLife achieved strong success in positioning its new-generation risk offering to the market, this being evident
through strong continued adoption of the Vitality-integrated model with the Vitality Optimiser product comprising 63% of all new business sales in the six
months to 31 December 2015. The period also showed lower mortality for Vitality Optimiser cases versus non-Vitality Optimiser cases. 2016 will also see
the introduction of a new form of life insurance integration and dynamic pricing using both the wellness of the client through Vitality and the underlying
interest rates to create a better match of premium to client overall cost of risk. This product innovation presents a sophisticated client expense and risk
management product, and economically robust new business values for VitalityLife.

Finally, new business commenced being written on the VitalityLife insurance licence on 1 January 2016.


VitalityHealth

From a financial perspective, the period was dominated by the extensive work undertaken following the exit of the Transitional Services Agreement (TSA)
with Standard Life Healthcare. This work resulted in significant unplanned and exceptional costs for the period, predominately in the areas of IT
development, administration and claims, in the order of £5 million. VitalityHealth returned to new business API growth (+24%) despite a complex
environment characterised by aggressive new business pricing and increases in the Insurance Premium Tax, which impacts on the end price paid by
consumers. Strong growth was generated in the more profitable Individual (+24%) and Direct channels (+21%), VitalityHealth's areas of focus, while less
profitable Corporate new business declined over the period. VitalityHealth's lapse rates remained strong over the period.

During the period under review, VitalityHealth made excellent progress in further embedding its wellness-integrated insurance model. From a product
perspective, VitalityHealth's new virtual primary care service, Vitality GP, resonated strongly with members and is delivering on its mandate to provide
integrated wellness and sickness pathways. Nearly half of those who have used the service have received wellness coaching from the Vitality GP. Active
Rewards, which was initiated in the UK, saw significant behaviour change in the complex area of physical activity engagement, with 34% of members who
had not previously engaged in physical activity now doing so for the first time. In addition, overall Vitality engagement is at an all-time high and continues
to increase across all dimensions of the programme.

During October, VitalityHealth concluded a joint purchasing agreement with Aviva Health for the procurement of hospital services. The Healthcare
Purchasing Alliance, with approximately 25% share of the market, creates a new, significant player of scale that will negotiate hospital tariffs on
VitalityHealth's behalf, which should positively support the loss ratio going forward.

3.3 Discovery Partner Markets (DPM)

Discovery Partner Markets now comprises significant global operations, with limited capital deployment. Over the period, the business experienced a
period of continued growth across established markets, and expansion within the Asia-Pacific region and new markets. In addition, the overwhelming
response to Vitality Active Rewards in both the UK and SA confirmed the veracity of the Vitality model and its ability to effectively promote healthy
behaviour. This led to the investment and development of a global Vitality Active Rewards platform.

The devaluation of the Rand against the US Dollar between the end of the last interim reporting period and the current period had the effect of
augmenting Dollar-based losses in both The Vitality Group (TVG) and Ping An Health.


TVG

The period was a noteworthy one for TVG for multiple reasons. First, the combination of the shared-value pricing structure and investments in the
distribution support channel saw a positive response from the large Employee Benefits broking houses. In addition, TVG significantly strengthened its
member engagement toolkit with a new member portal, enhanced features on mobile, and new challenges engine. The business also realised positive
member engagement with a direct correlation to improved health outcomes. Finally, the period was noteworthy for its endorsement of Vitality's business
model. TVG's client McKesson won the C. Everett Koop National health Award - in recognition of the effectiveness of the Vitality programme in improving
the health of its employees.

From the perspective of John Hancock, early traction in the market reflected pleasing support of shared-value products by John Hancock's distribution
channels.


Manulife Vitality

A significant development over the period involved Discovery entering into an agreement with John Hancock's parent company, Manulife, for Canada. This
will see the roll-out of shared-value products in Canada in the latter half of the 2016 calendar year, where Manulife is the largest life insurance company
with over 13.5 million clients across all product types.


AIA

The last six months saw AIA Vitality continue to expand its footprint across the Asia-Pacific region. In addition to Australia and Singapore, where AIA Vitality
is already established, AIA Vitality has now launched in Hong Kong and the Philippines.


Generali

A framework agreement has now been reached, and the business has shifted its focus towards roll-out in Germany, followed by France. The launch of
Generali Vitality to staff in Germany is imminent, with the public launch due before the end of the financial year.


Ping An Health

Healthcare reform is one of the core subjects in the Government's new five-year plan that relies heavily on private business involvement.

This trend is expected to build on the business' already-impressive performance, where Ping An Health realised total new business sales of R752 million,
comprising R173 million and R579 million in the Group and Individual segments respectively during the period. This represents an overall increase of 77%
on the corresponding period in 2014. Despite new business strain realised in full in the year business is written, the strategic decision is to focus on
growth and expand along new lines such as with the launch of the Group mid-market product.

Business fundamentals also remained strong within Ping An Health. Loss ratios for both the Individual and Group products were well managed and below
expectation, while lapse rates in all areas of the business remained as expected throughout the period.


04 | Prospects for Future Growth and Trading Statement

The progress made over the past six months - specifically the substantial investment in new initiatives and the capital restructuring to support this and to
ensure robustness - positions Discovery positively for long-term growth.

Due to the once-off accounting treatment resulting from the lapsing of the put options Prudential held in respect of its interest in the UK joint venture,
Discovery's undiluted headline earnings per share and basic earnings per share for the year ending 30 June 2016 (""next period"") is expected to be at least
20% lower (176.5 cents and 183.0 cents respectively) than that of the year ended 30 June 2015 (882.4 cents and 914.8 cents respectively). Normalised
headline earnings per share, which the Company views as the most appropriate measure of its performance, will not be impacted by this accounting
treatment.

Any forecast information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed and reported by the Group's external auditors and a further trading
statement will be released when the Company has the reasonable certainty required to be able to provide specific guidance.

Available-for-sale financial assets are shareholder investments. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of these assets are
recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income. When the assets are sold the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in profit or
loss as net realised gains/losses on available-for-sale financial assets. Interest income and dividends received from these assets are recognised as
investment income in profit or loss.

Financial assets designated as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are those that are held in internal funds to match insurance and
investment contract liabilities that are linked to the changes in the fair value of these assets. Discovery recognises interest income, dividends received,
realised and unrealised gains and losses from these assets in profit or loss in 'Net fair value gains on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss'.

Fair value hierarchy of financial instruments

The Group's financial instruments measured at fair value have been disclosed using a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy has three levels that reflect the
significance of the inputs used in measuring fair value. These are as follows:

Level 1 includes financial instruments that are measured using unadjusted, quoted prices in an active market for identical financial instruments. Quoted
prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent
actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.

Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data. Instruments in this category are
valued using:

(a) quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which are not considered to be active or

(b) valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.

Level 3 includes financial instruments that are valued using valuation techniques that incorporate information other than observable market data and
where at least one input (which could have a significant effect on instruments' valuation) cannot be based on observable market data.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments in level 2

-   Discovery has invested in equity linked notes offered by international banks in order to back certain unit-linked contract liabilities. The calculation of
    the daily value of the equity linked investments is made by the provider of the note. Discovery has procedures in place to ensure that these prices are
    correct. Aside from the daily reasonableness checks versus similar funds and movement since the prior day's price, the fund values are calculated with
    reference to a specific formula or index, disclosed to the policyholders, which is recalculated by Discovery in order to check if the price provided by the
    provider is correct.

-   If a quoted market price is not available on a recognised stock exchange or from a broker for non-exchange traded financial instruments, the fair value
    of the instrument is estimated by the asset managers, using valuation techniques including the use of recent arm's length market transactions,
    reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow techniques, option pricing models or
    other valuation techniques that provide a reliable estimate of prices obtained in actual market transactions.

-   The fair value of the hedged derivatives is calculated by the issuers of those instruments, as follows:


    (a) The fair value of call options is calculated on a Black-Scholes model.

    (b) The fair value of the return swaps is calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the instruments.

    (c) The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.

1 The inter-segment funding of R215 million reflects a notional allocation of interest earned on the negative reserve backing policyholders' funds of guaranteed investment products and hence is transferred to Discovery Invest.
The segment information is presented on the same basis as reported to the Chief Executive Officers of the reportable segments. The segment total is then adjusted for accounting reclassifications and entries required to produce IFRS compliant results. These adjustments include the
following:

2 The VitalityLife results are reclassified to account for the contractual arrangement as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4.

3 The Discovery Unit Trusts (DUT) are consolidated into Discovery's results for IFRS purposes. In the Segment information the DUT column includes the effects of consolidating the unit trusts into Discovery's results, effectively being the income and expenses relating to units held by third
parties.

4 Investment income on assets backing policyholder liabilities is included as part of the normalised profit from operations in the segmental disclosure, but is included together with shareholder investment income for IFRS purposes.

1 The inter-segment funding of R234 million reflects a notional allocation of interest earned on the negative reserve backing policyholders' funds of guaranteed investment products and hence is transferred to Discovery Invest.
The segment information is presented on the same basis as reported to the Chief Executive Officers of the reportable segments. The segment total is then adjusted for accounting reclassifications and entries required to produce IFRS compliant results. These adjustments include the
following:

2 The VitalityLife results are reclassified to account for the contractual arrangement as a reinsurance contract under IFRS 4.

3 The Discovery Unit Trusts (DUT) are consolidated into Discovery's results for IFRS purposes. In the Segment information the DUT column includes the effects of consolidating the unit trusts into Discovery's results, effectively being the income and expenses relating to units held by third
parties.

4 Investment income on assets backing policyholder liabilities is included as part of the normalised profit from operations in the segmental disclosure, but is included together with shareholder investment income for IFRS purposes.

1 This does not agree to the normalised profit from operations per the segmental information due to the inclusion of the additional 54.99% share of
DiscoveryCard profits discussed below.



Significant transactions affecting the current results

Increase in the DiscoveryCard profit share arrangement

Discovery and FirstRand Bank Limited (FRB) currently have a joint arrangement in place that makes a ""Discovery"" branded FNB credit card (DiscoveryCard)
available to the clients within the Discovery Group. In terms of this arrangement, FRB pays Discovery an amount equal to 20% of the profits generated by
the DiscoveryCard.

In the period under review, both parties have agreed that Discovery will increase its economic interest in the DiscoveryCard by subscribing for redeemable
preference shares in the share capital of FRB. This will entitle Discovery to receive an additional 54.99% of the profits generated by the DiscoveryCard. In
December 2015, Discovery paid R1.4 billion to FRB in this regard. The contractual rights under the preference shares were finalised subsequent to
31 December 2015 and the payment has therefore been accounted for as a prepayment in 'Loans and receivables' in the statement of financial position.

Once the preference shares have been issued, Discovery will be entitled to the additional 54.99% profits from the DiscoveryCard effective from 1 July 2015.
At 31 December 2015, the after tax profit share in respect of the additional 54.99% has been calculated as R58 million and has been added to Normalised
Headline Earnings.


Increase in borrowings

During the prior financial year, Discovery entered into a GBP 100 million term facility with HSBC Bank Plc which would be used to fund the operations of
VitalityLife. At 30 June 2015, GBP 26.4 million of the facility was utilised. During the current financial period, Discovery has drawn on the remaining balance
of GBP 73.6 million, increasing borrowings by R1.6 billion. Finance charges of R40 million in respect of these borrowings has been recognised in profit or
loss.

During the period under review, Discovery has also entered into a short-term bridge loan of R2.6 billion with RMB Limited to fund the subscription of the
FRB preference shares discussed above and to further fund its international operations.


Refinancing of BEE transaction by a BEE partner

In December 2005, Discovery concluded a BEE transaction pursuant to which 38 725 909 shares were issued to a consortium of BEE parties. 14 226 181 of
these shares were issued to the Discovery Foundation (The Foundation) being one of the BEE consortium members, at R0.001 each, for an initial period of
10 years (initial period).

The difference between the market value of the ordinary shares issued to the BEE parties and the subscription consideration, represented an outstanding
funded amount provided by Discovery shareholders (funded amount). These shares were treated as treasury shares.


At the end of the initial period,

- Discovery had the right to repurchase such number of ordinary shares at R0.001 per share that would provide Discovery with a notional return of the
funded amount.

- In order for The Foundation to retain the full number of Discovery shares originally issued to them, The Foundation then had the right to simultaneously
acquire from Discovery, at the then thirty-day volume-weighted average price per Discovery share, the same number of shares repurchased by Discovery.

The initial period expired in December 2015 and resulted in the following transactions:

- Discovery repurchased 5 666 134 Discovery shares held by The Foundation at a price of R0.001 per Discovery share.

- The issue to The Foundation by Discovery of 5 666 134 new Discovery shares at a price of R144.22 per Discovery share (representing the 30 day VWAP to
9 December 2015). This increased Share Capital and Share Premium by R817.2 million.

Treasury shares have therefore decreased by 14 226 181.


Increase in cash and cash equivalents

The Discovery Unit Trusts are consolidated into Discovery's results for IFRS purposes. At 31 December 2015, the cash held by the Discovery Balanced fund
increased by R1.6 billion to reduce equity exposure in this fund.


Other significant items in these results

Share-based payments

Included in marketing and administration expenses, in employee costs, is R245 million (2014: R203 million) in respect of phantom shares and options
granted under the employee share incentive schemes, which is expensed in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2. Discovery has entered into
transactions to hedge its exposure to changes in the Discovery share price arising from these schemes. As at 31 December 2015, approximately 91.7%
(2014: 92.6%) of this exposure was hedged. Fair value gains of R126 million (2014: R96 million) relating to the hedge were recognised in profit or loss
resulting in a net expense to Discovery of R119 million (2014: R107 million).


Taxation

For South African entities that are in a tax paying position, tax has been provided at 28% (2014: 28%) in the financial statements. No deferred tax assets
have been recognised on the assessed losses in Discovery Insure and The Vitality Group.

At 30 June 2015, a deferred tax asset of R295 million was raised in respect of the VitalityHealth assessed losses. This approximated 50% of the potential
deferred tax asset and was based on forecast taxable income for the next five years. No further asset has been raised in the current results.


Material transactions with related parties

Discovery Health administers the Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) and provides managed care services for which it charges an administration fee
and a managed healthcare fee respectively. These fees are determined on an annual basis and approved by the trustees of DHMS. The fees totalled 
R2 285 million for the six months ended 31 December 2015 (2014: R2 094 million). Discovery offers the members of DHMS access to the Vitality programme.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss have increased by R3.4 billion due to the sale of Discovery Invest products.


Negative reserve funding

The negative reserve funding liability on Discovery's Statement of Financial Position represents the acquisition costs that are funded by Prudential on
behalf of VitalityLife. The liability unwinds and is repaid on a matched basis as the cash flows emerge from the assets arising from insurance contracts. In
the event that the cash flows do not emerge as anticipated, VitalityLife would be required to repay these liabilities from other resources.

The decrease in the negative reserve funding liability relates to the repayment of funding by VitalityLife in the current period.


Deferred tax liability

The deferred tax liability is primarily attributable to the application of the Financial Services Board directive 145. This directive allows for the zeroing on a
statutory basis of the assets arising from insurance contracts. The statutory basis is used when calculating tax payable for Discovery Life, resulting in a
timing difference between the tax base and the accounting base.


Restatement of earnings per share

In the prior financial year, Discovery raised capital by way of an underwritten renounceable rights issue. This resulted in an increase in capital of R5 billion.
Shares in issue increased by 55 555 556 shares to 647 427 946 shares.

When ordinary shares are issued at a discount to the market price, IAS 33 (Earnings per Share) requires that the discount is treated as a bonus given to
the shareholders in the form of shares for no consideration and this ""bonus"" element must be separately taken into account in calculating the weighted
average number of shares. Further IAS 33 requires that the ""bonus"" shares must be added to the previous period in order to reflect the bonus element in
the rights issue. This has resulted in a restatement of the prior period's earnings per share calculations for the ""bonus"" element of 16 065 241 shares.

Accounting policies

Embedded value statement
for the six months ended 31 December 2015

The embedded value of Discovery consists of the following components:

- the free surplus attributed to the business at the valuation date;

- plus: the required capital to support the in-force covered business at the valuation date;

- plus: the present value of expected future shareholder cash flows from the in-force covered business;

- less: the cost of required capital.

The present value of future shareholder cash flows from the in-force covered business is calculated as the value of projected future after-tax shareholder
cash flows of the business in-force at the valuation date, discounted at the risk discount rate.

The value of new business is the present value, at the point of sale, of the projected future after-tax shareholder cash flows of the new business written by
Discovery, discounted at the risk discount rate, less an allowance for the reserving strain (for Life), initial expenses and cost of required capital. The value
of new business is calculated using the current reporting date assumptions.

For Life, the shareholder cash flows are based on the release of margins under the Statutory Valuation Method (""SVM"") basis.

The embedded value includes the insurance and administration profits of the covered business in the Discovery Limited group. Covered business includes
business written in South Africa through Discovery Life, Discovery Invest, Discovery Health and Discovery Vitality, and in the United Kingdom through
VitalityLife (previously PruProtect) and VitalityHealth (previously PruHealth). For The Vitality Group (USA), Ping An Health and Discovery Insure, no
published value has been placed on the current in-force business as the businesses have not yet reached suitable scale with predictable experience.

In August 2011, Discovery raised R800 million through the issue of non-cumulative, non-participating, non-convertible preference shares. For embedded
value purposes this capital, net of share issue expenses, has been excluded from the adjusted net worth.

In November 2014, the following events occurred:

- Prudential Assurance Company (Prudential) agreed to sell its remaining 25% shareholding in Prudential Health Holdings Limited (PHHL) to Discovery
Limited for GBP 155 million (R2 790 million). Following the purchase of the remaining 25% in PHHL, PruHealth and PruProtect have been rebranded as
VitalityHealth and VitalityLife respectively.

- During the 2011 financial year, put options were granted to the non-controlling interests of PHHL and TVG LLC, entitling the non-controlling interest to
sell their interests in the subsidiaries to Discovery at contracted dates at fair value. In November 2014, both these put options lapsed, with the purchase
by Discovery of the remaining 25% of PHHL and TVG LLC.

- The HumanaVitality partnership concluded. As a result, Humana purchased The Vitality Group's 25% shareholding in HumanaVitality and The Vitality
Group purchased Humana's 25% shareholding in TVG LLC.

In December 2015, the initial period expired on the BEE transaction that was concluded in September 2005 with the Discovery Foundation. In the
transaction, shares were issued to the Discovery Foundation at R0.001 per share for an initial period of 10 years. At the end of this initial period Discovery
has the right to repurchase these ordinary shares at R0.001 per share which would provide Discovery with the notional return of the funded amount.
Simultaneously, the Discovery Foundation has the right to acquire from Discovery the same number of shares repurchased by Discovery. At the expiry of
the initial period, the above transactions were executed resulting in an increased share capital and premium of R817 million and a decrease of 14 226 181
treasury shares.

The 31 December 2015 embedded value results and disclosures were not subjected to an external review or audit.

1 Policy alterations relate to changes to existing benefits at the request of the policyholder.

2 The tax variance for Life and Invest arises due to a movement in the deferred tax asset which delays the payment of tax.

3 The projection term for Health and Vitality, Group Life and VitalityHealth at 31 December 2015 has not been changed from that used in the 30 June
2015 embedded value calculation. Therefore, an experience variance arises because the total term of the in-force covered business is effectively increased
by six months.

1 The United Kingdom Corporation tax rate assumed is 20% in 2016 to 2017, 19% in 2018 to 2020, and 18% beyond that.


The Discovery Limited embedded value is calculated based on a risk discount rate using the CAPM approach with specific reference to the Discovery beta
coefficient. From 30 June 2015 the methodology to derive the assumed beta was amended. Under this revised methodology, the assumed beta is set with
reference to the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time period. The beta will continue to be calculated with reference to the ALSI.
The resulting assumed beta will be fixed at this level unless the observed beta calculated using daily returns over a long time period departs significantly
from this assumption at the financial year end. As beta values reflect the historic performance of share prices relative to the market they may not allow
fully for non-market related and non-financial risk. Investors may want to form their own view on an appropriate allowance for these risks which have not
been modelled explicitly.

Life and Invest mortality, morbidity and lapse and surrender assumptions were derived from internal experience, where available, augmented by
reinsurance and industry information.

The Health and Vitality lapse assumptions were derived from the results of recent experience investigations.

The VitalityHealth assumptions were derived from internal experience, augmented by industry information.

VitalityLife assumptions were derived from internal experience, where available, augmented by reinsurance, industry and Discovery Limited group
information.

Renewal expense assumptions were based on the results of the latest expense and budget information.

The initial expenses included in the calculation of the embedded value of new business are the actual costs incurred excluding expenses of an exceptional
or non-recurring nature.

The South African investment return assumption was based on a single interest rate derived from the risk-free zero coupon government bond yield curve.
Other economic assumptions were set relative to this yield. The current and projected tax position of the policyholder funds within the Life company has
been taken into account in determining the net investment return assumption.

The best estimate investment return assumption for VitalityHealth and VitalityLife was based on the single interest rate derived from the risk-free zero
coupon sterling yield curve. The United Kingdom expense inflation assumption was set in line with long-term United Kingdom inflation expectations.

It is assumed that, for the purposes of calculating the cost of required capital, the Life and Invest required capital amount will be backed by surplus assets
consisting of 100% equities and the Health, Vitality and VitalityHealth required capital amounts will be fully backed by cash. The VitalityLife required capital
amount is assumed to earn the same return as the assets backing the VitalityLife policyholder liabilities. Allowance has been made for tax and investment
expenses in the calculation of the cost of required capital. In calculating the capital gains tax liability, it is assumed that the portfolio is realised every 5
years. The Life and Invest cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the gross of tax equity return and the equity return net of tax
and expenses. The Health and Vitality and VitalityHealth cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the risk discount rate and the
net of tax cash return. The VitalityLife cost of required capital is calculated using the difference between the risk discount rate and the net of tax asset
return assumption.


Sensitivity to the embedded value assumptions

The embedded value has been calculated in accordance with the Actuarial Society of South Africa's Advisory Practice Note APN 107: Embedded Value Reporting. The risk discount rate, calculated in accordance with the practice note, uses the CAPM approach with specific reference to the
Discovery beta coefficient. As beta values reflect the historic performance of share prices relative to the market they may not allow fully for non-market related and non-financial risk. Investors may want to form their own view on an appropriate allowance for these risks which have not been
modelled explicitly. The sensitivity of the embedded value and the embedded value of new business at 31 December 2015 to changes in the risk discount rate is included in the tables below.

For each sensitivity illustrated below, all other assumptions have been left unchanged. No allowance has been made for management action such as risk premium increases where future experience is worse than the base assumptions.

*Restated for the bonus element of the rights issue on 7 April 2015 
 
Normalised headline earnings (which management believe is the most relevant indicator of business 
performance) is expected to increase by between 5% and 10% in the current period. This is lower than 
the Company’s historic growth in normalised headline earnings due to: 
     i.   An increased investment in new initiatives, including the recently awarded Bankmed medical 
          scheme administration and managed care contract, the expansion of the business model into 
          banking and increased costs arising from growth in Ping An Health and other International 
          Partner Markets; and 
    ii.   Higher than expected costs associated with moving VitalityHealth in the UK onto its own system 
          infrastructure. 
           
Normalised headline earnings per share for the current period is impacted by the increase in total shares 
in issue, following implementation of the Rights Issue in April 2015. 
 
Headline earnings per share and basic earnings per share for the prior period were positively impacted 
by the once-off accounting treatment resulting from the lapsing of the put options Prudential held in 
respect of its interest in the UK joint venture – this was due to Discovery’s purchase of the Prudential’s 
remaining 25% of the joint venture in November 2014. As this once-off increase in profits occurred 
during the Company’s 2015 financial year, all results announcements relating to the 2015 financial year 
will be affected for comparative purposes, as previously advised in the results announcement for the 
year ended 30 June 2015 released on SENS on 10 September 2015.  
 
Discovery’s results for the current period are due to be released on SENS on 25 February 2016. 


The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported 
on by the Company’s external auditors.

REFINANCING OF BEE TRANSACTION BY THE DISCOVERY FOUNDATION 

Shareholders are referred to the circular issued to Discovery shareholders on 15 November 2005 
(""Circular"") and approved at a general meeting of the Company held on 8 December 2005, relating to a 
Black Economic Empowerment (""BEE"") transaction, pursuant to which Discovery issued 7.05% of 
Discovery’s then issued share capital to a consortium of BEE parties (""BEE Transaction""). In terms of the 
BEE Transaction, Discovery issued 14 226 118 shares (2.59% of Discovery’s then issued share capital) at 
R0.001 each to the Discovery Foundation (""The Foundation""), being one of the BEE Transaction 
consortium members, for an initial period of 10 years (""Initial Period"").  

Pursuant to the BEE Transaction, and as described in the Circular, Discovery and The Foundation entered 
into a subscription agreement (""Foundation Agreement"") regulating, amongst other things: 
•   the issue of the abovementioned Discovery shares to The Foundation; 
•   a call option granted to Discovery to repurchase such number of shares at R0.001 per share, as 
    calculated with reference to an agreed formula, as to provide Discovery with a notional return 
    on the notional commencement amount, at the end of Initial Period; and 
•   the right of The Foundation to subscribe for the same number of shares repurchased by 
    Discovery in terms of the call option referred to above, in order to restore The Foundation’s 
    shareholding in the Company to the level held prior to Discovery’s exercise of the call 
    option/repurchase (""Foundation Agreement""). 
           
Shareholders are advised that the Initial Period has expired and that The Foundation has resolved in 
terms of the Foundation Agreement to refinance its shareholding in Discovery which entails – 
•   The repurchase by Discovery of 5 666 134 Discovery shares held by The Foundation, at a price of 
    R0.001 per Discovery share; and 
•   The issue to The Foundation by Discovery of 5 666 134 new Discovery shares at a price of 
    R144.22 per Discovery share, representing the 30 day VWAP to 9 December 2015.
