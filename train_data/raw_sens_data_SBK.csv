STANDARD BANK GROUP AND THE STANDARD BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED
RATING ACTION BY MOODY’S INVESTOR SERVICES

In accordance with paragraph 6.8 of the JSE Debt Listings
Requirements, noteholders are hereby advised that on 24 November
2020, Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s) downgraded the long-term
issuer rating of the holding company, Standard Bank Group Limited
(“SBG”) from Ba2 to Ba3. The rating agency also downgraded The
Standard Bank of South Africa Limited’s (“SBSA”) long-term local and
foreign currency deposit ratings from Ba1 To Ba2 and affirmed the
NSR long-term bank deposit rating. The outlook remains negative.

Moody’s rating downgrade of SBG and SBSA follows their decision to
downgrade the ratings of the Government of South Africa on 20
November 2020, to Ba2 from Ba1 and maintain the negative outlook.

The downgrade by Moody’s, in itself, is not expected to have a
material impact on SBG’s and SBSA’s risk weighted assets (RWA) and
capital adequacy. The group remains well capitalised and liquid.

1 Themovement in the FCTR was primarily as a result of the depreciation of the Rand against the USD, GBP and
 certain African currencies.
Update on the group’s performance for the nine months ended 30 September 2020

The group remains committed to supporting our customers, employees and communities during this difficult time.
Our three phased approach - respond, recover and re-imagine – remains relevant and underpins our decision
making for the “now” and the “next”.

In 3Q20, lockdowns continued to be eased or lifted, and economic activity improved across the countries in which
we operate in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite these positive developments, we remain on high alert. Our business
continuity management programmes, including safety protocols, remain in place. Over 70% of our employees are
still working from home and many will continue to do so for the rest of the year.

From an economic perspective, we remain of the view that 2Q20 was a low point and expect an improvement in
subsequent quarters, particularly in South Africa. We continue to track in line with our previous macro-economic
expectations in South Africa, and slightly better in Africa Regions. In South Africa, our growth forecast remains
unchanged from those provided at our 2020 Interim results on 20 August 2020; real GDP is expected to contract
by 8.5% in 2020 and expand by 4.5% in 2021. Low global inflation (including low oil prices) and subdued local
demand will continue to help contain inflation in South Africa (CPI expected to average 3.3% in 2020 and 4.1% in
2021). While real GDP is also expected to contract on average across the countries in which we operate in sub-
Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa), the contraction is expected to be much less severe than in South Africa.
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are expected to report real GDP growth in 2020. The timing and shape of the
recovery remains subject to disruptions caused by new waves of infection, both in Africa and in key trading
partners. In addition, country-specific risks in Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe remain
elevated.

Against this backdrop, the group continues to provide significant support to our retail, business and commercial,
and wholesale clients via a variety of measures. Pleasingly, as economies have opened, our clients have
required less support, and many have resumed their payments. All requests for additional relief and/or extensions
have been subject to appropriate client-specific risk assessments.

By 30 September 2020, the Personal & Business Banking South Africa (PBB SA) client relief portfolio had
declined from R107 billion as at 30 June 2020 to R61 billion. On the lapsed accounts (i.e. where the payment
holiday period granted had expired and the relief had not been extended) the average monthly instalment
payment rate was >95% for the secured portfolios (mortgages and VAF), >90% for the unsecured portfolios (card
and personal unsecured) and 100% for business lending. Of the extended portfolio (i.e. where the payment
holiday period granted had expired and the relief period had been extended), 83% thereof was secured.
Provision coverage on the remaining R61 billion client relief portfolio increased relative to 30 June 2020.

In PBB Africa Regions (PBB AR), the client relief portfolio declined from R11 billion as at 30 June 2020 to
R6 billion as at 30 September 2020. Of the balance outstanding c.56% is to business customers, >75% is
secured and >75% relates to exposures to clients in Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria and Uganda. The performance of
the lapsed book is better than the rest of the portfolio – 99% in stage 1 and 2. Provision coverage on the
remaining R6 billion client relief portfolio increased relative to 30 June 2020.

The table below provides the PBB SA and PBB AR client relief portfolios as at 30 June 2020 and 30 September
2020:

 PBB – client relief loans                                   South Africa, Rbn           Africa Regions, Rbn
 Outstanding as at 30 June 2020                                             107                            11
 As a % of total respective portfolios                                     18%                           12%

 Outstanding as at 30 September 2020                                          61                             6
 As a % of total respective portfolios                                      10%                             7%

In addition, as at 30 September 2020 the group had approved R10 billion of loans under the South African
Covid-19 loan guarantee scheme (up from R8.3 billion as at 30 June 2020).

Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) client exposures with restructured terms increased to R70 billion (from
R48 billion as at 30 June 2020). CIB continues to monitor certain sector- and client-specific risks closely; namely
Commercial Real Estate, Hospitality and Oil & Gas.

In 3Q20, PBB disbursements continued to recover from lows in April 2020. In South Africa, attractive house
prices and lower interest rates supported sales activity and in turn, mortgage disbursements in the quarter.
Period on period, growth in PBB’s unsecured portfolios continued to outpace that of the secured portfolios.
Growth of the PBB Africa Regions’ portfolio continued to outpace PBB South Africa. In CIB in 3Q20, lending to
corporates in South Africa slowed relative to 1H20, however lending growth in Africa Regions remained robust.
Customer deposit growth period on period remained robust.

The significant interest rate cuts year to date are an increasing drag on margins and net interest income (NII). In
South Africa, we do not expect any further interest rate cuts this year (after cumulative cuts of 300 basis points to
the end of July 2020). We expect a 25 basis point increase in 2021. In Africa Regions, inflation is broadly in
check and rates are expected to remain at similar levels through to the end of the year. Trading activities slowed
in 3Q20 but remained a key driver of non-interest revenue growth year to date. In South Africa, PBB account
turnover levels recovered to at or around pre-Covid levels (personal accounts slightly above and business
accounts slightly below). Larger businesses recovered faster than smaller businesses. Physical channel activity
levels (branch and ATM) improved but remained below pre-Covid levels, negatively impacting fees. In PBB Africa
Regions, ongoing customer acquisition supported fees.

Cost containment remains a focus. IT costs remained elevated as we continued to invest, particularly in digital
client capabilities. In light of the NII and activity-related fee pressures, we expect negative jaws for FY20.
Pre-provision operating profit growth was marginally negative period on period.

Credit trends to date are in line with our expectations. While initial indications are that collections have improved
in 3Q20 relative to 2Q20, retrenchment claims have also increased. The latter, combined with broader customer
stress, resulted in an increase in non-performing loans and additional impairment charges as balances
transferred from stage 1 or 2 to stage 3. There remains a risk that the environment deteriorates, and the portfolio
performance is worse than currently expected; for example, due to new waves of infection, subsequent
lockdowns and further job losses.

In 3Q20, Africa Regions’ performance continued to support group performance, offsetting ongoing strain in South
Africa. The West Region continues to perform particularly well. The scale and diversity of the group’s revenue
streams across client, product and geography remains a key advantage.

ICBC Standard Bank (ICBCS) continued to report a positive result year to date. Liberty’s performance remains
sensitive to market and Covid-related developments.

Group profit attributable to ordinary shareholders for the nine months to 30 September 2020 was 52% lower than
the comparative period. Group headline earnings was 39% lower than in the comparative period. There were no
additional material headline adjustable items in 3Q20. The group’s net asset value has grown 5% year to date.

The group is well capitalised and liquid. In terms of funding, market pricing continued to improve in the quarter
and in late September, the group’s issue of R1.5 billion of Additional Tier 1 bonds was well supported and priced
at attractive levels. Based on current planning, the group expects to continue to have sufficient capital to pay
preference share dividends. The South African Reserve Bank’s guidance on ordinary dividends remains in place
at this stage.

In line with the group’s commitment to improve disclosures on climate-related matters, the group has published
its Interim TCFD report; it is available to download on the group’s ESG and Investor Relations websites.

The group’s Basel III disclosure as at 30 September 2020 will be released in November 2020.

Looking forward, the Covid-19 pandemic, together with global economic weakness, elevated uncertainty and
depressed sentiment, is expected to negatively impact employment, incomes and equality globally. Emerging
Markets, including sub-Saharan Africa, face high external debt and a dependency on sectors most exposed to
the pandemic. They risk being disproportionately impacted, particularly in terms of an increase in poverty and
inequality.

While impacted by turmoil in the global financial market, South Africa’s ultimate trajectory will be dependent on
the execution of the structural reforms required to support higher growth, job creation and government debt
stabilisation. Standard Bank, together with many others in the private sector, will continue to work with the
government and labour in support of positive, sustainable outcomes. The progress in terms of institutional reform
is pleasing.

As a large, purpose-driven African-focused financial institution, we recognise the important role we can play in
supporting the recovery of the markets in which we operate. In addition, the change in customer expectations,
combined with the acceleration of digital adoption, provide an opportunity to expand our offering and our impact.
Lastly, the group is indebted to our employees who continue to assist and advise our customers and support our
communities despite the challenges and threats. We thank our employees for their ongoing commitment and our
customers and other stakeholders for their ongoing support.

The financial information contained in this announcement and that on which the operational performance update
is based has not been reviewed and reported on by the group's external auditors.

RESULTS OVERVIEW
“Globally, 1H20 has been dominated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the distressing human and economic cost thereof. During this time, we have
remained steadfast in support of our clients, our employees and the communities in the countries we operate in.” - Sim Tshabalala, Group Chief Executive

Group results
Standard Bank Group’s (SBG or the group) results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 (1H20) reflect that of a resilient, well diversified underlying
franchise, negatively impacted by a very difficult environment, particularly in South Africa. The group’s Africa Regions business and Corporate and
Investment Banking business, most notably Global Markets, delivered strong top line growth. The group’s strong capital and liquidity positions going into
this crisis, have allowed us to provide significant temporary relief to clients without constraining our ability to lend to existing and new clients or support
new projects.

The group’s banking operations’ earnings were supported by strong balance sheet growth, robust trading revenues and well contained costs. Positive jaws
of 100 bps supported pre-provision operating profit, which grew 4% period on period to R24.3 billion. Credit impairment charges increased to R11.3 billion,
2.7 times those reported in the prior period (1H19) and reflective of the tough environment and outlook. Consequently, banking operations reported
headline earnings of R7.7 billion, down 40% on 1H19, and a return on equity (ROE) of 9.5%.

Group headline earnings were R7.5 billion, a decline of 44% on 1H19, and ROE was 8.5%. The group’s capital position remained robust, with a common
equity tier 1 capital adequacy (CET1) ratio as at 30 June 2020 of 12.6%. Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders declined 71% to R3.8 billion. The
difference between headline earnings and profit attributable can be ascribed to a R1.4 billion post-tax gain on the sale of the 20% stake in Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (Argentina) S.A. and its affiliates (ICBCA), the associated R3.4 billion negative impact of the foreign currency translation
reserve (FCTR) release on sale and R1.9 billion related to the impairment of certain IT intangible assets. The gain on sale of the group's stake in ICBCA
and the reserve impact are both outside of headline earnings and therefore did not impact group headline earnings. The release of the FCTR balance to
earnings was a movement between reserves and therefore did not impact the net asset value of the group.

Operating environment
Covid-19 has led to the worst economic shock in living memory. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic and
countries responded with widespread lockdowns. Supply chains were disrupted, and demand declined. An oil price war and oversupply drove a swift and
significant decline in the oil price. Fear and uncertainty drove a precipitous fall in the markets and a liquidity squeeze in 1Q20. This was quickly followed by
extraordinary fiscal and monetary actions and fiscal stimulus (in particular, in developed markets) and a variety of regulatory actions. These bold actions,
combined with flattening infection curves, calmed markets somewhat and drove a recovery in 2Q20.

The considerable uncertainty in 1H20 drove an Emerging Market risk-off stance for foreign investors. Sub-Saharan Africa experienced record capital
outflows and financial conditions tightened. Trade and foreign exchange inflows dried up and oil-exporters were negatively impacted by the lower oil price.
Covid-19 related regulatory actions included wide-spread interest rate cuts, easing of capital and liquidity requirements and fee waivers and restrictions.
West Africa was impacted by the lower oil prices, East Africa, by lower trade and a halting of travel and the South and Central economies remained
closely coupled with South Africa.

In South Africa, the interrupted power supply extended the 4Q19 recession into 1Q20. Strict lockdowns brought the economy to a near-standstill.
Prospects of a modest economic recovery in 2020 were replaced with expectations for a large decline (Standard Bank Research: South Africa’s real GDP
is forecast to decline 8.5% in 2020 followed by a 4.5% recovery in 2021). The poor economic outlook and declining inflation trend paved the way for
cumulative interest rate cuts equating to 275 bps in the period. In addition, the South African government implemented a sizeable stimulus package to
support those most vulnerable. Whilst necessary, the additional spending poses a material risk to the public debt trajectory. Fiscal diligence and urgent
structural reforms are more important than ever.

Personal & Business Banking
PBB revenues declined 1% to R35.1 billion. Negative endowment, and related margin compression, more than offset the revenue increases related to
balance sheet growth. NIM declined 42 bps to 559 bps. NIR declined 5% as increased digital transactional volumes and modest annual price increases
were insufficient to offset the significant lockdown-related decline in physical channel volumes, turnover reductions, a drop in trade activity and regulatory
restrictions introduced on certain fees in Africa Regions. Credit impairment charges increased to R8.6 billion (1H19: R3.7 billion), 2.3 times 1H19 charges.
Lockdowns disrupted businesses and impacted client incomes and encouraged customers to transition to our digital channels leading to digital transaction
volumes increasing.

Corporate & Investment Banking
CIB revenues grew 11% to R21.4 billion. During this period of significant volatility and disruption, CIB continued to proactively engage with clients to
provide tailored funding, liquidity and risk management solutions. CIB’s capabilities and reach remains attractive to domestic clients and multi-national
corporates already operating, seeking to operate or seeking to expand on the continent. The business continued to benefit from diversification across
clients, sectors and regions. Africa Regions delivered a strong performance. Significant margin pressure offset strong balance sheet growth to deliver flat
NII. Cost growth was contained at 5%, delivering positive jaws of 639 bps and an improved cost-to-income ratio of 49.6%. Pre-provision operating profit
grew 19% period on period.

Central and other
This segment includes costs associated with corporate functions and the group’s treasury and capital requirements that have not been otherwise allocated
to the business units. The segment costs, including the R500 million (pre-tax) central provision amounted to R851 million (1H19: R593 million). We
continue to proactively manage the costs recorded in the centre.

Other banking interests
ICBC Standard Bank (ICBCS) recorded a profit of USD70 million in 1H20 (1H19: loss of USD130 million). The group’s 40% share of ICBCS’ earnings
equated to R508 million.

In August 2019, the group exercised its option to sell its 20% stake in ICBCA to the Industrial Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). The sale was completed
on 29 June 2020, post receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals.

Liberty
In 1H20, Liberty’s performance was negatively impacted by higher morbidity and mortality claims, new business strain and the creation of a R2.2 billion
post-tax pandemic provision to cover future costs related Covid-19 which are still expected to arise. The Shareholder Investment Portfolio performance
reflected negative investment market returns, particularly in respect of foreign and local equities. Liberty reported a headline loss of R2.3 billion (1H19:
earnings of R2.0 billion). After adjusting for treasury shares, the group’s share of the loss amounted to R0.7 billion (1H19: earnings of R0.9 billion).

Prospects
In the month of July, customer activity and business turnover levels continued to recover. While this should be supportive for NIR growth into 2H20,
ongoing uncertainty is expected to constrain balance sheet growth. Lower interest rates are expected to persist throughout 2H20, which will put pressure
on NII. Trading revenues are expected to be below 1H20 levels. PBB provision levels, while deemed sufficient, are sensitive to macro-economic
developments as well as client behaviour. Where appropriate, PBB has agreed to extend payment holidays and other relief measures. Client behaviour
post the expiry thereof will be key. Forecast risk remains high and should the outcome be worse than expected, additional provisions will be required.
While current CIB provision levels are deemed appropriate, CIB exposures, by their nature, are lumpy and additional provisions may be required if ratings
deteriorate further and/or individual clients experience difficulties. The Board will take into account the SARB’s guidance and group’s capital position and
the outlook before deciding whether to declare a final dividend. We are unable to provide revised medium-term targets at this time.

Covid-19 has already had a profound impact globally and there remains much uncertainty as to the ultimate human and economic toll. In addition,
US/China tensions remain a risk. In contrast, lockdowns will be rolled back, and economies will reopen. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting
global real GDP to contract by 4.9%, sub-Saharan Africa by 3.2% and South Africa by 8.0% in 2020, followed by a recovery of 5.4%, 3.4% and 3.5%
respectively, in 2021. Accordingly, we shift our focus to recovery. Leveraging the group’s strong capital position, we will continue to work with our
individual, business and corporate clients, in a responsible manner, to find suitable solutions to enable them to participate and support the much-needed
transition to the recovery phase.

The world changed fundamentally and, to some extent, permanently, in a matter of weeks. While the pandemic has created distress and anxiety for many
people, it has also created new opportunities, specifically the opportunity to accelerate change. As a group operating across the continent, with operations
and clients across the globe, we need to adapt to remain relevant. As we re-imagine the future, we remain of the view that our future-ready strategy
remains valid. However, we recognise the need to accelerate our digital delivery and, in parallel, drive operational efficiency. We remain committed to
delivering a positive societal, economic and environmental impact. Combined, this will ensure we remain relevant to our customers, attractive to our
employees and enable us to deliver value to all stakeholders. And, in doing so, we will also deliver on our purpose of driving Africa’s growth.

    The non-redeemable, non-cumulative, non-participating preference shares (SBPP) are entitled to a dividend of not less than 77% of the prime interest rate multiplied by the subscription price
    of R100 per share.

The above dates are subject to change. Any changes will be released on the Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) and published in the South African
and Namibian press.

Tax implications
The cash dividend received under the preference shares is likely to have tax implications for both resident and non-resident preference shareholders.
Such shareholders are therefore encouraged to consult their professional tax advisers.

In terms of the South African Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, the cash dividend will, unless exempt, be subject to dividends tax that was introduced with effect
from 1 April 2012. South African resident preference shareholders that are not exempt from dividends tax, will be subject to dividends tax at a rate of 20%
of the cash dividend, and this amount will be withheld from the cash dividend with the result that they will receive a net amount of 2.60 cents per first
preference share and 266.400 cents per second preference share. Non-resident preference shareholders may be subject to dividends tax at a rate of less
than 20% depending on their country of residence and the applicability of any Double Tax Treaty between South Africa and their country of residence.

The issued share capital of the company, as at the date of declaration, is as follows:
• 1 619 929 317 ordinary shares at a par value of 10 cents each
• 8 000 000 first preference shares at a par value of R1 each
• 52 982 248 second preference shares at a par value of 1 cent each and subscription price of R100.

The company’s tax reference number is 9800/211/71/7 and registration number is 1969/017128/06.

Additional operational update and trading statement update for the six-month period ended 30
June 2020

Operational update

Despite considerable effort, the pandemic appears to be gaining momentum in certain of the markets
in which the group operates on the continent, particularly in South Africa. Elsewhere in the world,
countries are battling with a second wave of infections. The path from here remains uncertain and this
continues to weigh on sentiment and demand.

Against this backdrop, Standard Bank recognises the importance of continuing to support our clients,
our staff and the communities in the markets in which the group operates.

In June 2020, the group continued to receive additional client relief requests, however the rate slowed
month-on-month. All requests remain subject to internal credit assessment processes. Total relief
provided by the group to clients increased from May to June. In addition, the group continued to
receive applications for funding under the South Africa Covid-19 SME Loan Guarantee Scheme.
Applications are assessed and funds disbursed in line with the scheme requirements. Standard Bank
welcomes the recent amendments to the scheme, in particular removing the business size threshold
and relaxing some of the restrictions imposed on businesses that participate.

As noted in the JSE Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) announcement on 1 June 2020,
disbursements and transaction activity levels were negatively impacted by the lockdowns, in particular
in April 2020. Activity levels did improve in May and June as lockdowns were eased, but in most
instances, remained below pre-lockdown levels.

On 29 June 2020, Standard Bank completed the sale of its 20% stake in ICBC Argentina (ICBCA) to
the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited on the terms announced on SENS on 8 August
2019. The sale price was fixed in US Dollars (USD) and the carrying value of the investment was held
in Argentinean Peso (ARS). In the period between announcing the sale in August 2019 and
completion of the sale in June 2020, the South African Rand (ZAR) weakened relative to the USD and
the ARS weakened relative to the ZAR. As a result, the group’s gain on sale was higher than
previously estimated (R1.4 billion vs R0.6 billion) and the accumulated foreign currency translation
reserve (FCTR) debit balance was also higher than previously estimated (R3.4 billion vs R2.9 billion).
Under IFRS, the accumulated balance on the FCTR is required to be released to earnings upon
completion of the disposal.

The net impact of R2.0 billion negatively impacts earnings attributable to the group in the six-month
period ended 30 June 2020. The gain on sale and the FCTR impact are both outside of headline
earnings and therefore do not impact group headline earnings.
The release of the FCTR balance to earnings is a movement between reserves and therefore does
not impact the Net Asset Value of the group. The disposal will be marginally positive for the group’s
common equity tier 1 ratio.

With regards to Liberty Holdings Limited’s (Liberty) performance, please refer to Liberty’s
announcement released on SENS on 27 July 2020.

As at 30 June 2020, the group remained well capitalised and liquid.

Trading statement update

In accordance with section 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, and as an update
to the trading statement published on 1 June 2020, shareholders are advised that Standard Bank is
satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists with regards to the group’s financial results for
1H20. The group’s headline earnings per share (HEPS) for 1H20 is expected to be between 30% and
50% lower than the reported HEPS for the six-month period ended 30 June 2019 (“comparative
period”), translating into a decrease from the comparative period’s HEPS of 837.4 cents per share to
a range of between 586.2 and 418.7 cents per share.

The group’s earnings per share (EPS) for 1H20, is expected to be between 60% and 80% lower than
the comparative period, translating into a decrease from the comparative period’s EPS of 827.0 cents
per share to a range of between 330.8 and 165.4 cents per share.

The difference between the HEPS and EPS ranges can be attributed to the accounting consequences
of the finalisation of the sale of ICBCA, as referenced above, and an impairment of certain IT
intangibles following an internal review. Additional information regarding the IT impairments will be
provided when the group reports interim results.

1H20 Results

Standard Bank will release interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 on 20 August 2020.
Details are available on the Standard Bank Group Investor Relations website -
https://reporting.standardbank.com/

The pandemic is proving to have a profound human and economic impact across the globe. We
would like to assure our customers and our staff that we are here to support them. We would like to
also thank all those in the broader Standard Bank community for their continued commitment to
servicing our customers and supporting one another.

Shareholders are advised that the information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed
or reported on by the group’s auditors.

Voluntary trading update and trading statement for the six month period ending 30 June 2020

Trading update

Shareholders are advised that the outlook for the twelve month period ending 31 December 2020
(FY20) continues to deteriorate. In sub-Saharan Africa, the human impact of the Covid-19 pandemic
is growing. Standard Bank recognises the need to “flatten the curve”. We will continue to prioritise the
safety and wellbeing of our employees and our customers, while also supporting community initiatives
in the countries in which we operate.

The group also recognises the significant impact the lockdowns have had, and continue to have, on
our clients. While the lockdowns in some of our markets started to ease or be lifted in early May,
South Africa’s lockdown has continued to constrain large parts of the economy. In Africa Regions, the
group’s African operations outside South Africa, the lockdown period has averaged 37 days. South
Africa has been under a relatively restrictive lockdown for 63 days. We welcome the SA
Government’s decision to transition to level 3 and open-up more of the economy.

While the economic data is likely to take some time to catch up, the toll of the lockdowns is starting to
emerge. By 28 May, the Personal and Business Banking division (PBB) had provided R92 billion in
relief to individuals, SMMEs and commercial clients in SA across 285 000 accounts and R11 billion to
predominantly commercial PBB clients in Africa Regions across 14 000 accounts. The Corporate &
Investment Banking division (CIB) had concluded restructures for eligible clients with risk exposures
amounting to approximately R30 billion. To date, the CIB requests have largely originated in SA.

From a Standard Bank perspective, the lockdowns negatively impacted sales, disbursements and
transaction activity levels. In South Africa, in April deeds offices and dealerships were closed which
halted mortgage disbursements and resulted in a more than 70% decline in VAF disbursements
compared to March. In addition, ATM and branch volumes were down 38% and 61% respectively.
While there has been an improvement in activity levels during the course of May, they remain below
those seen prior to the lockdown.

There remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the impact that the Covid-19 pandemic and the
associated governmental responses will have on the economies in the markets in which the group
operates, and in turn, on the group. While we remain unable to provide guidance with regards to the
group’s performance for the year ending 31 December 2020, we wish to provide some high-level
commentary on the factors influencing the FY20 outlook.

Year to date, all the currencies across the 20 markets in which the group operates on the continent
have weakened relative to the USD. The South African Rand (ZAR), Zambian Kwacha and
Zimbabwean Dollar have weakened the most. In contrast, the countries in the group’s East Africa
Region have held up relatively well. While the ZAR is expected to strengthen by year end, it is likely to
be weaker on average relative to the USD and the Africa Regions currencies year on year. This will
support the earnings contribution from Africa Regions. Inflation has remained relatively subdued
despite currency weakness. There have been policy interest rate cuts in all but three markets, with
South Africa seeing the largest cumulative decline to date at 275 bps. In 2020, the economies in 12 of
our 20 Africa countries are expected to contract; South Africa, Botswana and Namibia are expected to
see the biggest declines. Our current expectation for South Africa is an 8.5% decline in real GDP in
2020, followed by a 6.5% recovery in 2021. The East Africa Region economies (Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda) are currently expected to avoid a contraction.

Loan growth in the first 4 months of 2020 (4M20) was robust. The combination of higher digital
disbursements, corporate facility drawdowns and a weaker ZAR led to strong double-digit growth
period on period. CIB grew faster than PBB. In PBB, unsecured lending grew faster than secured
lending. Loan growth is expected to slow from current levels. Low business and consumer confidence
levels are expected to continue to be a constraint on secured portfolio growth. While instalment relief
is likely to temporarily support portfolio levels, this is likely to be offset by lower new business
disbursements. Unsecured lending growth will be subject to individual affordability and business and
sector viability over the medium term. Deposit growth was also strong period on period, in particular
demand deposits, as corporates drew down on facilities to access liquidity and placed it back on
deposit. Deposit growth is also expected to slow.

Balance sheet growth will partially offset a meaningful decrease in net interest margin on the back of
higher funding costs and negative endowment following the significant policy interest rate cuts seen to
date. In South Africa, a 25 bps movement equates to an annualised R300 million net interest income
impact. The group’s current assumption is that there will be no further policy rate cuts in South Africa
in 2020. Non-interest income growth, while supported by trading income in 4M20, will depend on the
pace and magnitude of the recovery in 2H20. Containing operating expense growth remains a focus.
Where possible, cost levers will be pulled, but not at the expense of the resilience of our systems or
our ongoing digital customer journeys.

Credit impairment charges have the greatest potential for variability and will depend on the depth of
the recession and pace of the recovery. In the modelling of expected credit losses, IFRS 9 requires
the consideration of the current portfolio performance, comprising individual counterparty and portfolio
performance, and a forward-looking view. In determining the latter, one is required to apply judgement
and make a number of forward-looking assumptions. We note the guidance and clarification provided
by the Prudential Authority in Guidance Note 3/2020 and Guidance Note 6/2020 in this regard. Our
current scenario analysis indicates that the group’s credit loss ratio for FY20 will be above the group’s
through-the-cycle range of 70 bps to 100 bps and may exceed the peak recorded in the Global
Financial Crisis of 160 bps.

The group ceased accruing earnings from its 20% stake in ICBC Argentina post the decision to sell its
stake in August 2019. ICBC Standard Bank Plc (ICBCS) incurred a significant single client loss in
FY19 which should not repeat in FY20. ICBCS’ ability to break even remains subject to better
integration with ICBC’s client base.

With regards to Liberty Holdings Limited’s (Liberty) performance, please refer to Liberty’s voluntary
operational update announcement released on the JSE Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) on 14
May 2020 and the trading statement released on SENS on 29 May 2020.

On capital, funding and liquidity, the group supports the actions taken by the South African Reserve
Bank. As at 31 March 2020, the group’s common equity tier one ratio was 12.9% and liquidity
coverage ratio was 141.9%. As at 30 April 2020, the group remained well capitalised and
liquid. Based on our scenario analysis, the group’s capital ratios are expected to remain strong and
above required minimums. In line with the Prudential Authority’s guidance on dividends, the group is
not planning to declare an FY20 interim ordinary dividend.

If the pandemic-related impacts are deeper or more sustained than currently expected, or government
actions are not effective, the group’s results could vary meaningfully. The group is reviewing the
group’s medium-term financial targets and will provide an update as and when able to do so.

Trading statement

Shareholders are advised that Standard Bank’s headline earnings per share (HEPS) and earnings per
share (EPS) for the six-month period ending 30 June 2020 are expected to be more than 20% lower
than the reported HEPS and EPS for the comparable period (1H19 HEPS: 837.4 cents, 1H19 EPS:
827.0 cents). We will issue a further trading statement with more specific guidance ranges once there
is reasonable certainty regarding the extent of the decline relative to the comparable period.

Standard Bank’s results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 are expected to be released on the
SENS on 20 August 2020.

The complexity and uncertainty surrounding the crisis has been stressful for our employees and we
thank them for their ongoing commitment. In a dynamic and broad crisis such as this, the depth of
skills and experience across the group has proven invaluable. In addition, the group is confident it has
the governance and risk management structures in place to ensure the appropriate and timely flow of
information required to support agile and effective decision-making. A large proportion of the group’s
employees across the continent, and in our international offices, continue to work productively from
home. This would not have been possible without our strategic partnerships and the systems
investments the group has made in recent years. Our digital customer channels have also proven
resilient.

While our immediate priorities remain employee, customer and community safety and support, we
also recognise the need to lift our heads and plan for the recovery phase and the opportunities a “new
normal” may bring. With our operational business continuity plans now well embedded, our focus is
increasingly moving towards growing the sustainable strength of our client franchise.

Authority has reduced Pillar 2A buffer requirements with effect from 6 April 2020. This will reduce the minimum capital requirement
to 10.5% from that date (approximately R7.3 billion reduction in total minimum regulatory capital requirements based on March
2020 results). There is currently no requirement for the countercyclical buffer add-on in South Africa or in other jurisdictions in
which the SBSA has significant exposures.
Liquidity Coverage Ratio
In terms of the Basel III requirements in Directive 11/2014 issued in terms of section 6(6) of
the Banks Act, (Act No. 94 of 1990), banks are directed to comply with the minimum
disclosure on the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) on both a Standard Bank Group consolidated
as well as SBSA Solo entity level. This disclosure is in accordance with Pillar 3 of the Basel
III liquidity accord.

The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of the 30-calendar day liquidity profile,
by ensuring that banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet potential
outflows in a stressed environment.

Net Stable Funding Ratio
In terms of the Basel III requirements in Directive 8/2017 issued in terms of section 6(6) of
the Banks Act, (Act No. 94 of 1990), banks are directed to comply with the minimum
disclosure on the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) on both a Standard Bank Group
consolidated as well as SBSA Solo entity level. This disclosure is in accordance with Pillar 3
of the Basel III liquidity accord.

The objective of the Basel III Net stable funding ratio (NSFR) is to promote funding stability
and resilience in the banking sector by requiring banks to maintain a stable funding profile in
relation to the composition of assets and off-balance sheet activities.

1 The movement in the FCTR was primarily as a result of the depreciation of the Rand against the USD, GBP and
 certain African currencies.
2 Primarily   comprises the ordinary dividends declared in March 2020.
Update on the group’s operational performance for the three months ended 31 March 2020


In the three months to 31 March 2020 (“1Q20”), the operating environment in South Africa deteriorated and
consumer and business confidence declined further. In Africa Regions, lower oil prices threatened oil exporters
and declines in global demand, in particular from China, negatively impacted export-reliant economies. The
Covid-19 crisis escalated quickly in March 2020. By 31 March 2020, global asset values had declined materially,
emerging markets had seen large risk-off outflows and there were partial or full lockdowns across almost all of
the markets in which we operate.

The group quickly and successfully instituted its business continuity management plans, with a focus on ensuring
the safety of our employees and the continued service to our clients. These are now well embedded, and the
focus has turned to supporting those clients who are experiencing financial strain in these difficult times.
Accordingly, we support actions taken by the South African Reserve Bank, and others, to mitigate the economic
impact, reduce stress in the system and release capital to facilitate support to individuals and businesses.

Turning to the group’s banking performance in 1Q20. Net interest income growth was slow as fairly robust year-
on-year loan growth was offset by negative endowment and margin pressure. Non-interest revenue growth was
supported by an increase in trading revenue. In South Africa, sales activity and ATM, card and branch volumes
declined in late March as lockdowns and other restrictions were implemented. Operating expenses were well
managed and jaws were positive. Credit impairment charges for the period were significantly higher than in the
prior year. The increase was driven by deterioration in both the portfolio performance and the forward-looking
assumptions used in the modelling of expected credit losses.

IFRS 9 requires the group to consider forward-looking information in the calculation of expected credit losses.
Accordingly, the group has estimated an increase in economic stress caused by the crisis and, where
appropriate, incorporated that in the calculation of the group’s expected credit losses. It is worth noting that, by 31
March 2020, the Covid-19 related stress on individuals and businesses had, to a large extent, not emerged yet
and the provisions raised were based on our best estimate at the time.

Liberty Holdings Limited’s (“Liberty”) performance for the period was impacted by market movements, in
particular the Shareholder Investment Portfolio. Please refer to Liberty’s SENS announcement dated 21 April
2020. 1Q19 headline earnings included earnings from the group’s 20% stake in ICBC Argentina (“ICBCA”). The
group ceased equity accounting ICBCA earnings in September 2019 post the decision to sell the stake. The
group recorded a small loss associated with its 40% stake in ICBC Standard Bank PLC.

In 1Q20 earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders were 27% lower than in the comparative period. During
the period the headline earnings adjustable items were not material.

The group remains well capitalised and liquid. The group’s Basel III disclosure as at 31 March 2020 will be
released in May 2020.

The information contained in this announcement and that on which the operational performance update is based
has not been reviewed and reported on by the group's external auditors.

Ratings Announcement

Amendment to Standard Bank Group (“SBG”) and The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited
(“SBSA”) credit ratings by Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) and Moody’s Ratings Agency (“Moody’s”)

Noteholders are hereby advised of the amendment by Fitch and Moody’s to SBG’s and SBSA’s credit
ratings effective on 31 March 2020.

Fitch:

    •    Fitch has downgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and Viability Ratings (VRs)
         of SBSA to ‘BB’ and ‘bb’, respectively. The Outlook on the IDRs is Negative.
    •    Fitch has taken similar rating actions on the Long-Term IDRs and VRs of SBG.
    •    National Long-Term Ratings and debt ratings (where applicable) have also been downgraded
         from AA (zaf) to AA-(zaf).
    •    The Outlook on the National Long-Term Ratings is revised to Negative from Stable.
    •    Fitch has increased the notching for Tier 2 issues of SBG to two notches from one from the
         respective VR and National Rating anchor ratings.
    •    Fitch has also widened the notching between the IDR and the long-term debt rating assigned
         to SBG’s and SBSA’s USD4 billion EMTN Programme to one from zero to reflect (under the
         new criteria) below-average recovery prospects because of thin Qualifying Junior Debt buffers.

The rating action by Fitch is driven by the expected negative impact from the coronavirus outbreak on
the bank's operating environment and key financial metrics, notwithstanding uncertainty as to the full
economic and financial market implications.

For commentary on the detailed ratings action taken on SBG and SBSA, together with the other South
African Banks, please refer to the Fitch press release on the below website:
https://www.fitchratings.com

Moody’s:

    •    SBSA's long-term foreign-currency and local-currency issuer ratings to Ba1 from Baa3. The
         outlook remains negative.
    •    SBG's long-term foreign-currency and local-currency issuer ratings to Ba2 from Ba1. The
         outlook remains negative.

The primary driver for Moody’s rating actions is the increasingly difficult operating environment for banks
in South Africa as reflected by the agency’s decision to lower South Africa's Macro Profile score from
'Moderate' to 'Moderate-' in addition to the weakening credit profile of the South African government
given banks' high sovereign exposure, mainly in the form of government debt securities held as part of
their prudential liquidity requirements, which links their credit profiles to that of the government.
A detailed commentary on the ratings action taken on SBG and SBSA, together with the other South
African      Banks      may        be        accesses      on     the       below       website:

Standard Bank announces COVID-19 financial relief measures for its small enterprise and
student customers in South Africa

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the disruption it is expected to cause, The Standard Bank of
South Africa Limited (“SBSA” or the “bank”) has announced interim debt repayment relief measures to
help its small enterprise and student customers in South Africa manage their financial commitments.
These actions have been proactively deployed, consistent with measures implemented by financial
institutions in a number of other countries, to provide some relief to our customer base in anticipation
of the economic and cash flow constraints that are expected to arise due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Small enterprises

All SBSA small enterprise customers with turnover of less than R20 million, who have a business loan
with the bank and are in good standing with the bank at 31 March 2020, will automatically receive a
payment holiday from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020. Interest and fees will still accrue over the three
month period and will be capitalised to the loan. The terms of repayment will be automatically
extended to maintain the affordability of the facility once the payment holiday period expires.

This measure will not only assist our small business clients with managing their cash flows, but also
allow them to honour payments to their own employee base.

Students

All SBSA student customers still studying full time, who have a Standard Bank Student Loan and are
in good standing with the bank at 31 March 2020, will automatically receive a payment holiday from 1
April 2020 to 30 June 2020. Interest will be charged at 0% and fees will be zero for the three month
period. The terms of repayment will be automatically extended to maintain the affordability of the
facility once the payment holiday period expires.

As at 20 March 2020, SBSA’s qualifying, performing small enterprise portfolio equated to
approximately R12bn and student portfolio equated to approximately R1.5bn.

While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, it is difficult to estimate the likely negative impact
that it will have on Standard Bank’s financial performance. The group will continue to assess these
impacts and will provide appropriate disclosures when sufficient certainty exists.

The group remains well capitalised and liquid.

The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the group’s
auditors.

STANDARD BANK GROUP RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENT
for the year ended 31 December 2019

2019 results overview
""Standard Bank Group's results for the 2019 financial year are underpinned by the growth and resilience of
its core operations.""
- Sim Tshabalala, Group chief executive

Standard Bank Group's results for the 2019 financial year (FY19) are underpinned by the growth and resilience 
of its core operations. The constrained macroeconomic environment, particularly in South Africa, and ICBCS 
losses impacted the group's results.

The group's banking operations reported headline earnings up 5% on the prior year (FY18) to R27.2 billion
and a return on equity (ROE) of 18.1%. This result was driven by quality top line growth and continued positive
operating leverage. While Liberty contributed positively to group earnings growth, the group's other banking
interests were a drag. Group headline earnings were R28.2 billion, an increase of 1% on FY18, and ROE was
16.8%. The group's capital position remained strong, with a common equity tier 1 capital adequacy (CET1) ratio 
of 14.0%. A final dividend of 540 cents per share has been declared. Total dividends for the year were 2% higher
than the prior year.

Good balance sheet growth underpinned net interest income while non-interest revenue was supported by growth
in transaction volumes and trading revenues. Credit impairment charges increased of a low base in FY18. A
strong focus on cost containment continued throughout the year resulting in below inflation cost growth and
positive jaws of 113 basis points (bps).

Operating environment
In 2019, the US-China trade dispute, increase in geopolitical risks and weaker domestic demand across
multiple economies dampened global economic growth. Weaker demand suppressed inflation across local and
international markets which prompted central banks to reduce policy rates or adopt growth-supportive monetary 
policy stances.

Sub-Saharan Africa's economic growth forecasts were revised downwards consecutively. Headwinds on the
external front, alongside the slow pace of reforms, severe weather-related shocks, as well as an increase in
security and political tensions in parts of the region, weighed on economic activity.

In South Africa, load-shedding undermined growth prospects, the pace of policy progress and reform was slow,
and Eskom's fiscal concerns remained unresolved. Business and consumer confidence levels remained low,
constraining spending and demand for credit. The economy shrank 1.4% in 4Q19 which resulted in a second recession 
in less than two years. Real GDP growth for the year was 0.2%.

Personal & Business Banking
PBB's headline earnings grew 6% to R16.5 billion, underpinned by continued balance sheet and customer
franchise growth. Net interest income increased 6% to R44.1 billion, supported by balance sheet growth. A 
favourable change in product mix and higher average rates in South Africa supported an increase in margin. This 
was largely offset by lower average interest rate across the Africa Regions portfolio and the impact of IFRS 16. 
This resulted in a net interest margin of 601 bps, 3 bps higher than in FY18. In South Africa, our customers 
continued to migrate to our digital platforms, in particular the SBG mobile app. SBG mobile app active users 
increased 55% to 2.0 million and the value of transactions executed via our mobile banking platform increased 
46% to R382 billion.

Corporate & Investment Banking
CIB 's headline earnings grew 5%, 7% in constant currency change (CCY), to R11.8 billion. The operating
environment remained challenging and market conditions, volatile and fluid. Against this difficult backdrop, 
CIB continued to deliver the innovative, bespoke solutions our clients need and have come to expect. As a business
with on-the-ground operations across 20 countries in Africa, and operations in five financial hubs outside of
Africa, it remains uniquely positioned to connect global multinational companies to the African markets and
African businesses to international markets. Strong growth in both average assets and liabilities in
Transactional Products and Services (TPS) and double-digit average asset growth in Investment Banking (IB) 
supported revenues. Underlying client revenues grew 7% driven by the Financial Institutions, Mining & Metals, 
Power & Infrastructure and Telecoms, Media & Technology sectors.

Other banking interests
Despite the tough operating conditions in Argentina, ICBC Argentina (ICBCA) continued its strong performance
in FY19. In August 2019, the group exercised its option to sell its 20% stake in ICBCA to ICBC. Headline
earnings from the group's 20% stake amounted to R583 million.

ICBC Standard Bank Plc (ICBCS) recorded a disappointing set of results in FY19. The loss of USD248 million
consisted of a single client loss of USD198 million, USD30 million related to restructuring costs and USD20
million of operating losses related to the business operations. The latter was driven by lower revenues on fixed
income and currency trading due to subdued market sentiment. The group's 40% share of the losses equated to
R1.4 billion. ICBC and the group, as shareholders, have had robust conversations and made meaningful progress
with ICBCS management with regards to how best to put the business on a path to sustainable profitability. These
discussions resulted in a number of management actions in ICBCS, including significant headcount reductions
and a reduction by ICBCS of business lines and locations in FY19. Closer integration into and cooperation with
the ICBC group is an important element of the plan to achieve sustainable profit.

Liberty
Liberty is making progress towards re-building a competitive and sustainable business. While the focus on
new business volumes continues, normalised operating earnings improved 10% year on year. In FY19, the
Shareholder Investment Portfolio benefitted from improved investment market returns, particularly in respect of 
foreign and local equities. Liberty headline earnings grew 23% to R3.3 billion. The group's share of earnings 
amounted to R1.9 billion, up 16% on the prior year.

Prospects
Global economic growth is expected to remain slow and downside risks persist. These risks include, amongst
others, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, a rise in geopolitical and social unrest, and further
weather-related disasters. In contrast, subdued inflation and accommodative monetary policy should support 
financial conditions and, in turn, emerging market flows. Continued strong growth in East Africa and an ongoing 
moderate recovery in West Africa should favour sub-Saharan Africa's economic growth prospects. Conditions are 
expected to remain difficult in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. While the impact of COVID-19 on global growth remains
unknown, it is clear that a China slowdown and a disruption of Sino-Africa trade will negatively impact the 
trade balances of sub-Saharan African commodity exporters and be inflationary for importers.

In South Africa, while there were some positive governance and growth-related developments in 2019, there 
is still much more to be done. The constraints to growth and productivity are structural and the reforms
required are well understood. In the absence of tangible progress, we foresee sustained economic weakness, 
driven by insufficient electricity supply and low confidence.

The macro-economic outlook in the countries in which we operate is uncertain and the operating environment
is expected to remain challenging. Trading conditions are expected to remain difficult, regulatory-imposed
constraints and technological change are set to stay, and competition will continue to intensify. Our top priority
in 2020 is to increase our competitiveness by improving client experience through the seamless delivery of
relevant and personalised financial solutions to our clients in a secure manner via their channel of choice. We
will also continue to exercise tight cost discipline and seek to allocate resources efficiently and in support
of our strategy to build a future-ready Standard Bank Group. 

We are a purpose driven organisation: Africa's our home, we drive her growth. We recognise that the role we
play, as the gate-keeper and facilitator of financial flows into and across Africa, is much bigger than
profits alone. Our long-term sustainability is inextricably linked to the social and economic upliftment of the
people and societies in the countries in which we operate. Accordingly, we will continue to contribute positively
to Africa's social, economic and environmental development.

Tax implications
The cash dividend received under the ordinary shares and the preference shares is likely to have tax
implications for both resident and non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders. Such shareholders are therefore
encouraged to consult their professional tax advisers.

In terms of the South African Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, the cash dividend will, unless exempt, be subject
to dividends tax that was introduced with effect from 1 April 2012. South African resident ordinary and
preference shareholders that are not exempt from dividends tax, will be subject to dividends tax at a rate of 
20% of the cash dividend, and this amount will be withheld from the cash dividend with the result that they will
receive a net amount of 432 cents per ordinary share, 2.60 cents per first preference share and 311.296 cents per
second preference share. Non-resident ordinary and preference shareholders may be subject to dividends tax at
a rate of less than 20% depending on their country of residence and the applicability of any Double Tax
Treaty between South Africa and their country of residence.

The issued share capital of the company, as at the date of declaration, is as follows:
- 1 619 709 548 ordinary shares
- 8 000 000 first preference shares
- 52 982 248 second preference shares.

The company's tax reference number is 9800/211/71/7 and registration number is 1969/017128/06.
