NEW R1.33 BILLION DOMESTIC MEDIUM TERM NOTE PLACEMENT AND EXTENSION TO THE MATURITY OF R492.1 MILLION OF DOMESTIC 
MEDIUM TERM NOTES UNDER THE R15 BILLION DOMESTIC MEDIUM TERM NOTE PROGRAMME


Northam is pleased to announce that it has completed a private placement of domestic medium term notes
(“Notes”) to the value of R1.33 billion (“New Notes”) in a bookbuild under Northam’s R15 billion Domestic
Medium Term Note Programme (dated 29 October 2020, as amended and / or supplemented from time to time)
(“Programme”). The bookbuild was oversubscribed by 33%.


The New Notes were issued today, 25 November 2020, on the Interest Rate Market of the JSE Limited, primarily
as tap issuances under the following bond series: NHM011, NHM014, NHM016, NHM018 and NHM019
(“Existing Bond Series”) as well as issues under new bond series NHM020 (“New Bond Series”).


The New Notes issued under the Existing Bond Series attract floating rate coupons between 2.50% and 4.25%
per annum above the 3 month ZAR-JIBAR, with interest payable quarterly, as detailed in previously published
SENS announcements.

The New Notes issued under the New Bond Series mature on 25 November 2023 (R132 million) and attract a
floating rate coupon of 3.75% per annum above the 3 month ZAR-JIBAR with interest payable quarterly.


The New Notes issued under the Existing Bond Series and the New Bond Series have a staggered maturity
profile, maturing within the next 12 months (R10 million), 18 months (R345 million), 30 months (R253 million),
36 months (R132 million), 42 months (R390 million) and 54 months (R200 million) from the date of issue.


The proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes will be applied towards replenishing Northam’s cash reserves
utilised in the course of Northam’s ongoing acquisition of preference shares in Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited,
including as published on SENS on 15 October 2020.
Furthermore, pursuant to the announcement published on SENS on 28 October 2020 pertaining to the partial
capital redemption of Notes under bond series NHM017, Northam is pleased to announce that, on
30 October 2020, it completed a R492.1 million note switch, effectively extending the maturity date of certain
Notes issued under bond series NHM017, maturing on 26 February 2021. This was achieved through the
purchase and cancellation of such Notes and the simultaneous issue of new Notes to the same Note holders as
a second tranche under bond series NHM012, maturing on 13 June 2022, for the same aggregate nominal
amount (“Note Switch”). The NHM012 series Notes have a floating interest rate of 3.75% per annum above the
3 month ZAR-JIBAR, with interest payable quarterly.


Following the placement of the New Notes, the total nominal value of Notes in issue under the Programme
amounts to c. R7.13 billion.


The combination of the placement of the New Notes and the Note Switch provides significant additional balance
sheet flexibility for Northam.


Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer said “Northam is pleased to have such strong investor support
for our DMTN Programme. This continues to support Northam’s growth strategy and simultaneously allows the
Company to accelerate the return of value to shareholders.”

CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Northam shareholders are advised that Northam and Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (“Zambezi Platinum”)
have entered into discussions regarding a potential transaction to accelerate the maturity of the
empowerment transaction concluded between Northam and Zambezi Platinum in May 2015, whilst
maintaining Northam’s broad-based black economic empowerment ownership. If the transaction is
successfully concluded it may have a material effect on the price of Northam’s securities.

Accordingly, Northam shareholders are advised to exercise caution when dealing in Northam’s securities,
until a further announcement is published.

Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer said “the significant value created for all Northam
shareholders from our empowerment transaction with Zambezi Platinum, as well as Northam’s current
ownership of 70% of all Zambezi Platinum preference shares and the inherent share buy-back implied by
this holding, provides a unique opportunity to unlock permanent value for our shareholders, whilst
maintaining Northam’s broad-based black economic empowerment ownership. Northam has taken the
initiative to enter into pro-active discussions with Zambezi Platinum with a view to secure a successful and
sustainable outcome.”

Platinum Limited ZAR10 000 000 000 Domestic Medium Term Note Programme (dated 3 August 2012, as
amended and / or supplemented from time to time) (the “Programme”), of the reduction in the nominal
amount of notes in bond series NHM017 (the “Relevant Notes”), guaranteed by Booysendal Platinum
Proprietary Limited, by an amount of R492.1 million (the “Purchased Notes”), on 30 October 2020.


 Bond Code:                                                                    NHM017

 Reduction in the nominal amount:                                              R492 100 000.00
 Remaining nominal amount in issue:                                            R2 800 000.00


The reduction in the nominal amount of the Relevant Notes was effected through the purchase by Northam
of the Purchased Notes in the market and the surrender by Northam of the Purchased Notes to the Transfer
Agent under the Programme for cancellation thereof on 30 October 2020.

The reduction in the nominal amount of the Relevant Notes forms part of a note switch whereby the maturity
dates of Purchased Notes will be extended through a purchase and cancellation of such notes and the
simultaneous issue of new notes for the same nominal amount as a second tranche under series NHM012,
which has a longer maturity date.

NORTHAM INCREASES ITS ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARE HOLDING TO APPROXIMATELY 70% BY ACQUIRING 
R3.5 BILLION OF ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES


Northam shareholders are referred to the announcement dated 18 August 2020 (“previous announcement”)
pertaining to the acquisition by Northam of preference shares in Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (“Zambezi”)
(“Zambezi preference shares”).

Northam is pleased to announce that, since the date of the previous announcement, it has acquired an
additional 37 179 697 Zambezi preference shares for a total cash consideration of approximately R3.5 billion
(“ZPLP acquisitions”). Following the ZPLP acquisitions, Northam holds 111 909 248 Zambezi preference
shares (“Northam owned prefs”), representing approximately 70% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue.

The face value of the Northam owned prefs as at 15 October 2020, calculated as the initial issue price of the
Zambezi preference shares plus accumulated preference share dividends, amounts to approximately
R9.1 billion.

As stated in the previous announcement, Northam’s acquisition of Zambezi preference shares will reduce the
preference share dividend expense and liability included in Northam’s consolidated financial statements, as well
as Northam’s potential financial exposure under the guarantee it provided to holders of Zambezi preference
shares, should the guarantee be called upon. Furthermore, should Zambezi elect to redeem the Zambezi
preference shares through a distribution of ordinary shares in Northam (“Northam shares”) held by Zambezi,
then the redemption of the Zambezi preference shares held by Northam, at such time, will result in a distribution
of Northam shares to Northam, thereby reducing the number of Northam shares in issue.

The ZPLP acquisitions have been fully funded through Northam’s internal cash resources.

The ZPLP acquisitions are not categorised transactions in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and
information relating thereto is provided for information purposes only.

Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer said “Northam has continued to return significant value to
shareholders by accelerating the purchase of Zambezi preference shares to the current 70% holding. This
strategy will positively impact future earnings and earnings per share and will add to the success of our
empowerment transaction. Furthermore, Northam no longer considers the back-up guarantee provided in favour
of the Zambezi preference shareholders to be a dilution risk to Northam ordinary shareholders and this is a
significant milestone for the Company. Our mines and operations have proved to be resilient following the COVID-
19 induced national lockdown and the commitment demonstrated by the Northam employees in restoring
operations to normality has been outstanding.”

UPGRADE TO NORTHAM’S LONG TERM AND SHORT TERM CREDIT RATING, WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK                            

Northam is pleased to advise shareholders and noteholders that the credit rating agency, Global Credit
Rating Co. (“GCR”), has upgraded Northam’s national scale long term credit rating to A(ZA) (from the
previous rating of A-(ZA)) and short term credit rating to A1(ZA) (from the previous rating of A2(ZA)), with a
stable outlook.

The upgrade primarily reflects Northam’s strengthened earnings profile and expectations of continued
robust free cash flows and financial metrics on the back of favourable commodity prices. Other factors
sighted by GCR include, inter alia, the surge in Northam’s profitability over recent years enhanced by rising
production volumes, the positive manner in which Northam managed and recovered from the impact of
COVID-19, the group’s globally competitive cost position and Northam’s track record of maintaining
conservative financial policies. GCR continues to view Northam’s liquidity as strong.

The stable outlook reflects GCR’s view that the group will pursue a conservative financial profile and will
continue to benefit from its ongoing production ramp up against supportive pricing levels, which should
translate into robust margins and cash flows to sustain strong credit metrics over the next 12 to 18 months.

GCR’s announcement in regard to Northam’s credit rating is available from GCR’s website at
https://gcrratings.com/announcements/gcr-upgrades-northams-issuer-ratings-to-aza-a1za-on-

ABRIDGED AUDITED GROUP ANNUAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020 AND NOTICE
OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

Key features:

-   Record revenue of R17.8 billion
-   Record operating profit of R5.3 billion
-   Record EBITDA of R6.0 billion
-   Record normalised headline earnings of R3.4 billion equating to 676.3 cents per share, up 150.4%
-   Record profit after tax of R2.2 billion
-   Return of shareholder value, through 46.7% Zambezi preference share ownership
-   Net debt of R3.3 billion

Financial results

Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, this has been a record year for Northam. The company has
commenced the fourth strategic phase by returning meaningful value to Northam shareholders (“shareholders”)
and remains committed to returning further value going forward.

The group achieved record sales revenue, record operating profit and record earnings before interest, taxation,
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) for the year. These record outcomes were achieved notwithstanding
the impact of mine and production stoppages, which occurred as a result of the COVID-19 induced lockdown.
Prior and up to the commencement of the lockdown period, the group was on track to achieve record production
from own operations during the year ended 30 June 2020 (“F2020”).

Sales revenue increased by 67.3% to R17.8 billion (F2019: R10.6 billion) for the year. This increase is attributable
to a 60.8% rise in the 4E basket price to USD1 764/oz (F2019: USD1 097/oz) and a 10.9% weaker ZAR/USD
exchange rate realised.

Despite logistical hurdles associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including border closures that made the
distribution of refined metal challenging, the group maintained robust refined metal sales of 560 238 4E oz. This
highlights the strong relationships that Northam has developed and maintained with its industrial customer base
over many years.

The average US dollar sales prices achieved during the year under review improved for most metals. Palladium
and rhodium both performed well, increasing by 52.4% and 169.8%, respectively. Both these metals continued
their upward trends subsequent to the financial year end. Platinum however, making up roughly 60% of the sales
volume of Northam’s precious metals 4E basket, continues to be the laggard. The average price achieved during
the year was USD858/oz (F2019: USD824/oz), which impacted the 4E basket price achieved. Platinum now only
contributes 28.0% (F2019: 46.3%) to the 4E basket. Any upward movement in the platinum price will have a
positive impact on the profitability of the group.

The group continues to deliver on its strategy of developing low-cost, long-life assets which are positioning the
group for further strong financial performance even in subdued or potentially volatile commodity markets. The
benefit of Northam’s growth strategy, initiated in 2015, is evidenced by some of the key financial highlights listed
below:

Dividends and other means of returning value to shareholders

There are a number of ways that value can be returned to shareholders. This includes cash dividends, but also
includes share buy-backs or the purchase of the Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (“Zambezi”) preference shares.

During the year under review, Northam returned value to shareholders by acquiring 49 364 435 Zambezi
preference shares for R3.7 billion. Subsequent to year end an additional 21 134 297 preference shares were
acquired for R1.7 billion. Northam now holds 46.7% of the total issued number of Zambezi preference shares.

The board has therefore resolved not to declare a dividend for the financial year ended 30 June 2020 (F2019:
RNil).

ACQUISITION OF R804.6 MILLION OF ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES

Northam shareholders are referred to the announcement dated 2 July 2020 (“previous announcement”)
pertaining to the acquisition by Northam of preference shares in Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (“Zambezi”)
(“Zambezi preference shares”).

Northam is pleased to announce that, since the date of the previous announcement, it has acquired an
additional 9 635 664 Zambezi preference shares for a total cash consideration of approximately R804.6 million
(“ZPLP acquisition”). Following the ZPLP acquisition, Northam will hold 74 729 551 Zambezi preference
shares (“Northam owned prefs”), representing approximately 46.7% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue.
The face value of the Northam owned prefs as at 17 August 2020, calculated as the initial issue price of the
Zambezi preference shares plus accumulated preference share dividends, amounts to approximately R5.96
billion.

As stated in the previous announcement, Northam’s acquisition of Zambezi preference shares will reduce the
preference share dividend expense and liability included in Northam’s consolidated financial statements, as well
as Northam’s potential financial exposure under the guarantee it provided to holders of Zambezi preference
shares, should the guarantee be called upon. Furthermore, should Zambezi elect to redeem the Zambezi
preference shares through a distribution of ordinary shares in Northam (“Northam shares”) held by Zambezi,
then the redemption of the Zambezi preference shares held by Northam, at such time, will result in a distribution
of Northam shares to Northam, thereby reducing the number of Northam shares in issue.

The ZPLP acquisition has been fully funded through Northam’s internal cash resources.

The ZPLP acquisition is not a categorised transaction in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and
information relating thereto is provided for information purposes only.

TRADING STATEMENT AND TRADING UPDATE

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, companies are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they are satisfied, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the financial
results for the current reporting period will differ by at least 20% from the financial results of the previous
corresponding period.

Northam expects to achieve a record operating profit for the year ended 30 June 2020 (“F2020”),
underpinned by a solid performance at all operations and higher prices realised for our basket of metals.
This is despite significant production losses associated with the national lockdown (“Lockdown”) and
phased restart of mining activities following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa.

The group achieved production from own operations of 515 370 4E oz, representing a marginal 0.9%
decrease from the year ended 30 June 2019 (“F2019”) (F2019: 519 954 4E oz). Purchased material
increased by 212.9% to 72 443 4E oz (F2019: 23 154 4E oz). Sales volumes amounted to 582 686 4E oz,
which included ore sales (F2019: 583 069 4E oz.), whilst total revenue per platinum ounce sold increased
by 78.8% to R53 009/Pt oz (F2019: R29 640/Pt oz), resulting in a cash margin per platinum ounce in excess
of 40%.

The group achieved record sales revenue, record operating profit and record earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) for the year. These record outcomes were achieved
notwithstanding the impact of mine and production stoppages which occurred as a result of the COVID-19
induced Lockdown. Prior and up to the commencement of the Lockdown period, the group was on track to
achieve record production from own operations during F2020.

* Used to determine the basic and headline earnings per share, calculated as 509 781 212 shares in issue less
159 905 453 shares held by Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (“Zambezi”). Zambezi is Northam’s major empowerment
shareholder and Zambezi’s financial results are consolidated into the group’s financial results.

However, the Lockdown resulting from COVID-19 and consequential production stoppages have been
disruptive, and Northam’s proactive and positive response measures minimised the impact on production
to an equivalent estimated loss of 108 685 4E oz. Northam would like to extend its sincere appreciation to
management and our employees, in restarting the operations in a safe and effective manner and making a
concerted effort to achieve normalised production. Surface ore sources at Eland mine, together with
streamlined operations at the mechanised Booysendal mine, enabled a swift restart. By financial year end,
Booysendal mine and Eland mine were again operating at full complement, whilst Zondereinde mine was
operating at 80% capacity. Normalised production is expected to resume at Zondereinde by the second
half of the current financial year ending 30 June 2021 (“F2021”) with a corresponding reduction to our F2021
production estimate.

The health and wellness of our employees and our host communities were given priority in our response to
COVID-19. Our program for restarting operations drew on our many years of experience in managing
significant health threats such as HIV and tuberculosis. We followed the prescripts of the National Institute
for Communicable Diseases and the amended regulations pertaining to the Disaster Management Act No.
57 of 2002, working in collaboration with the various government departments and the Minerals Council.
Our program encompassed screening and identification for early diagnosis and treatment, as well as health
promotion through a variety of educational initiatives.

All growth projects progressed well during F2020. Booysendal South has advanced into production ramp-
up, Zondereinde Western extension is ahead of schedule and on reef development of Eland mine continued
whilst simultaneously increasing mineable reserve.

Despite significant logistical hurdles associated with COVID-19, including border closures that made the
distribution of refined metal challenging, the group maintained robust refined metal sales of 560 238 4E oz.
This highlights the strong relationships that we have developed and maintained with our industrial customer
base over many years.

Group unit costs were negatively impacted by lower production levels, as operating costs continued close
to pre-Lockdown levels. This was largely attributable to our decision to maintain payment of salaries and
ancillary benefits to all of our employees during the Lockdown period and phased restart, notwithstanding
the lost production and the phased restart’s negative impact on productivity.

In light of this, and as part of our COVID-19 response measures, the group proactively implemented a multi-
pronged action plan to preserve liquidity. This entailed a restructuring of the company’s domestic medium-
term note programme to significantly extend maturity dates of notes in issue, to raise some additional debt
funding and to generally smooth the maturity profile of the various note series (“Note Switch”). In addition,
our revolving credit and general banking facilities were refinanced on more favourable terms, extending the
maturity date whilst reducing the cost of debt. Both facilities were undrawn at financial year end.

In addition to direct production and revenue losses associated with COVID-19, the group incurred once-off
costs directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Lockdown period of R977.2 million (the bulk of
which relates to employee costs).

Total group capital expenditure reduced year on year to R2.4 billion as a result of capital intensive programs
at Booysendal mine either having been completed or nearing completion and thus tapering down in terms
of total annual expenditure. R2.0 billion was incurred on expansionary capital expenditure and R382.2
million on sustaining capital expenditure. A decision to temporarily scale back on specific growth projects
in the interest of liquidity preservation was made after the onset of COVID-19 and the concomitant
Lockdown period. However, the group remains committed to its strategy of developing low-cost, long-life
assets in order to position itself at the lower end of the industry cost curve and the group envisages no
lasting effects in this regard.

The development of our project pipeline, which builds on our existing asset base, is bearing fruit and will
continue to deliver a strong and sustainable financial performance in the coming years. Despite the effect
of the COVID-19 pandemic, Northam achieved record financial results for the year and generated significant
free cash. Our forecasted production growth, together with favourable rand denominated metal prices, are
expected to further support and enhance free cash flow generation over the medium-term.

Our strategy of returning value to shareholders remains unchanged and can be implemented through the
payment of dividends, a share buyback or a purchase of Zambezi preference shares. We believe that, to
date, the most efficient mechanism to return value to Northam’s shareholders has been through the
purchase of Zambezi preference shares.

The acquisition of the Zambezi preference shares reduces the preference share dividend expense and
liability included in the consolidated financial statements, as well as Northam’s potential financial exposure
under the guarantee provided to holders of Zambezi preference shares, should the guarantee be called
upon. Furthermore, in the event that Zambezi elects to redeem the Zambezi preference shares through a
distribution of Northam ordinary shares held by Zambezi, then the redemption of the Zambezi preference
shares held by Northam at such time will result in a distribution of Northam shares to Northam, thereby
reducing the number of Northam shares in issue.

To this end, Northam has continued to purchase Zambezi preference shares and held 53 595 254
preference shares at 30 June 2020, representing c.33.5% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue.
Subsequent to the financial year end, Northam acquired an additional 11 498 633 Zambezi preference
shares and currently holds 65 093 887 preference shares, representing c. 40.7% of all Zambezi preference
shares in issue. Purchases to date have returned R4.8 billion of value to Northam shareholders, R4.6 billion
of which was returned post F2019. Despite these purchases, the group achieved a net debt position of R3.3
billion with a net debt to EBITDA ratio well below 1 : 1 as at 30 June 2020. The average premium (expressed
as a percentage to face value, being the capital amount and all accrued preference share dividends,
calculated until the date of each acquisition) paid on these purchases has been less than 2.2%.

Northam’s purchases of Zambezi preference shares to date has reduced the preference share dividend
expense in the consolidated financial statements for F2020 by R299.7 million. The full positive impact on
the income statement arising from some of these purchases will only accrue in F2021 and this, combined
with the compounding effect of dividends accruing on Zambezi preference shares, is expected to contribute
positively towards reducing the preference share dividend expense in future.
The group’s balance sheet strength and the relatively quick recovery to production capacity, combined with
the positive impact on medium term liquidity arising from the Note Switch, collectively position the group
well to continue to proactively and aggressively return value to shareholders.

In summary, whilst F2020 has been a challenging year in the face of the global COVID-19 pandemic and
its wide-ranging knock-on effects, the company has performed well. Northam has efficiently managed the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has not wavered from its strategy of pursuing production growth
and asset diversification. We have delivered a meaningful return of value to our shareholders and look
forward to continuing to do more over the coming year.

The financial information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by
Northam’s auditors. The audited results for the year ended 30 June 2020 are expected to be published on
or about 28 August 2020.

ACQUISITION OF R959.7 MILLION OF ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES

Northam shareholders are referred to the announcement dated 3 April 2020 (“previous announcement”)
pertaining to, inter alia, the acquisition by Northam of preference shares in Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited
(“Zambezi”) (“Zambezi preference shares”).

Northam is pleased to announce that, since the date of the previous announcement, it has acquired an
additional 11 717 037 Zambezi preference shares for a total cash consideration of approximately
R959.7 million (“ZPLP acquisition”). Following the ZPLP acquisition, Northam will hold 65 093 887 Zambezi
preference shares, representing approximately 40.71% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue.

As stated in the previous announcement, Northam’s acquisition of Zambezi preference shares will reduce
the preference share dividend expense and liability included in Northam’s consolidated financial statements,
as well as Northam’s potential financial exposure under the guarantee it provided to holders of Zambezi
preference shares, should the guarantee be called upon. Furthermore, should Zambezi redeem the Zambezi
preference shares through a distribution of ordinary shares in Northam (“Northam shares”) held by Zambezi,
then the redemption of the Zambezi preference shares held by Northam, at such time, will result in a
distribution of Northam shares to Northam, thereby reducing the number of Northam shares in issue.

The ZPLP acquisition has been fully funded through Northam’s internal cash resources.

The ZPLP acquisition is not a categorised transaction in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and
information relating thereto is provided for information purposes only.

Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer said “Northam had set itself an ambitious internal target of
acquiring at least 40% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue in order to de-risk the company’s position
and to simultaneously return significant value to its shareholders through our unique empowerment
transaction. We are delighted to have achieved this target approximately halfway through the 10 year
structure. The group’s financial position remains strong amidst very challenging global economic times.”

NORTHAM COMPLETES A R2.65 BILLION RESTRUCTURING OF ITS DOMESTIC MEDIUM TERM NOTE
PROGRAMME, INCLUDING R411 MILLION OF NEW FUNDING

Northam shareholders and noteholders are referred to the announcement published by Northam on
SENS on 11 May 2020 pertaining to a R2.166 billion restructuring of Northam’s R10 billion Domestic Medium
Term Note Programme (dated 3 August 2012, as amended and / or supplemented from time to time)
(“Programme”), comprising a c.R1.885 billion note switch into longer term maturities and c.R281 million of new
funding.

Northam is pleased to announce that it has reached agreement with additional noteholders to participate in a
note switch to extend the maturity dates of certain domestic medium term notes (“Notes”) with an aggregate
nominal amount of R350 million, through the purchase and cancellation of such Notes and the simultaneous
issue of new Notes with longer term maturities, for the same nominal amount and to the same noteholders
(“Additional Note Switch”). Upon implementation, this will result in a total Note switch of c.R2.235 billion.
Furthermore, certain noteholders will provide new funding by subscribing for additional new Notes with an
aggregate nominal amount of R130 million (“Additional New Funding”), resulting in a total of c.R411 million of
new funding raised during this process.


The Additional Note Switch and the accompanying Additional New Funding completes the restructuring of the
maturities and fund raising which Northam set out to achieve in order to preserve its medium term liquidity in the
current global economic climate following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.


The Notes to be purchased and cancelled as part of the Additional Note Switch are issued under bond code
series NHM009 (R50 million) and NHM014 (R300 million). The new Notes to be issued as part of the Additional
Note Switch and Additional New Funding will be placed as a new tranche under each of the NHM016
(R130 million) and NHM018 (R350 million) series and will be issued on the same terms applicable to such series.
The NHM016 and NHM018 series have a maturity date of 11 May 2025 and 25 May 2023, respectively, and a
floating interest rate of 3 month ZAR-JIBAR plus 4.25% and 3.75%, respectively, with interest payable quarterly.


The following table summarises the impact of the total Note switch and the total new funding on the maturity
profile of the Notes under the Programme, in respect of Northam’s financial years ending 30 June. Values
represent the change in the nominal amount of Note maturities for each financial year.

Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer said “Northam is pleased to have successfully completed its
R2.65 billion restructuring of its DMTN Programme. This will assist significantly in preserving and strengthening
Northam’s liquidity position during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Northam is also pleased to have attracted
more than R400 million of additional new long-term funding during the lockdown period. We believe the company
is well placed to weather the ongoing COVID-19 challenges and we remain appreciative of the support of our
investors.”

R2.166 BILLION RESTRUCTURING OF NORTHAM’S DOMESTIC MEDIUM TERM NOTE PROGRAMME,
INCLUDING NEW FUNDING

Northam is pleased to announce that it has reached an agreement with certain holders of domestic medium term
notes (“Notes”) (“Noteholders”) under Northam’s R10 billion Domestic Medium Term Note Programme (dated
3 August 2012, as amended and / or supplemented from time to time) (“Programme”), to extend the maturity
dates of certain Notes with an aggregate nominal amount of c.R1.885 billion through the purchase and
cancellation of such Notes and the simultaneous issue of new Notes with longer term maturities, for the same
nominal amount and to the same Noteholders (“Note Switch”). Furthermore, certain Noteholders will invest
additional capital and subscribe for additional new Notes with an aggregate nominal amount of c.R281 million
(“New Funding”).

The Note Switch will preserve the group’s liquidity in the short to medium term by extending the maturity dates
of certain Notes, whilst the New Funding will provide additional liquidity and further strengthen the group’s balance
sheet over the short to medium term. The Note Switch will not increase the total nominal amount of Notes in
issue under the Programme whilst the New Funding will increase the total nominal amount of Notes in issue
under the Programme by c.R281 million, from R5.245 billion to c.R5.526 billion.

The Notes to be purchased and cancelled as part of the Note Switch were issued under bond code series
NHM002, NHM006, NHM007, NHM009, NHM010, NM011, NHM012, NHM013 and NHM014 and mature in
Northam’s financial years ending 30 June 2020, 2021 and 2022. The new Notes to be issued as part of the Note
Switch and New Funding (collectively, the “New Notes”) will mature over a nine month (c.R495 million), three
year (c.R671 million), four year (R450 million) and five year (R550 million) term from the date of issue. The nine
month, three year, four year and five year New Notes will attract a floating rate coupon of 2.40%, 3.75%, 4.00%
and 4.25% above the 3 month ZAR-JIBAR per annum, respectively. Interest on the New Notes will be payable
quarterly.

Following implementation of the Note Switch, the remaining maturities under the Programme pertaining to the
rest of the calendar year 2020 (“CY 20”) will reduce from R550 million to c.R20 million. Northam is pleased that
the large reduction in CY 20 maturities significantly reduces capital outflow during the current national lockdown
and related operational constraints as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, Northam has attracted
an additional c.R281 million of long-term funding during this period. The net effect for CY 20 is a c.R811 million
increase in liquidity derived from the Note Switch and New Funding.

The following table summarises the impact of the Note Switch and New Funding on the maturity profile of Notes
in issue, in respect of Northam’s financial years ending 30 June. Values represent the change in the nominal
amount of maturities of Notes for each financial year.

Northam shareholders are referred to the announcement published by Northam on SENS on 8 May 2020
pertaining to the listing of the NHM016 Note with a nominal amount of R550 million. c.R469 million of this amount
pertains to the Note Switch and c.R81 million pertains to the New Funding. Accordingly, Notes with a nominal
amount of c.R469 million will be purchased and cancelled by Northam on 11 May 2020, being the date of issue
of the NHM016 Note.

Further information pertaining to the Note Switch will be announced as and when the Note Switch is implemented
through the purchase of issued Notes and the issue of New Notes.

Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer said “Northam remains appreciative of the support and
confidence it continues to receive from investors in the Programme. The R1.885 billion note switch will assist in
preserving and strengthening Northam’s liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Added to this is a R530 million
reduction in maturities during calendar year 2020, coupled with an injection of R281 million of new capital,
resulting in an R811 million increase in calendar year 2020 liquidity. This is a very positive outcome for Northam.”

ACQUISITION OF R1.27 BILLION OF ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES, FULLY FUNDED THROUGH A
PLACEMENT OF R1.27 BILLION OF NOTES UNDER THE DMTN PROGRAMME, AND AN INCREASE IN
THE DMTN PROGRAMME AMOUNT TO R10 BILLION

1.   ACQUISITION OF ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES FOR R1.27 BILLION

     Northam shareholders are referred to the announcement dated 1 November 2019 (“previous
     announcement”) pertaining to the acquisition by Northam of preference shares in Zambezi Platinum (RF)
     Limited (“Zambezi”) (“Zambezi preference shares”).

     Northam is pleased to announce that, since the date of the previous announcement, it has acquired an
     additional 16.7 million Zambezi preference shares for a total cash consideration of approximately
     R1.27 billion (“ZPLP acquisition”). Northam now holds a total of 53 376 850 Zambezi preference shares,
     representing approximately 33.38% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue.

     As stated in the previous announcement, Northam’s acquisition of Zambezi preference shares will reduce
     the preference share dividend expense and liability included in Northam’s consolidated financial
     statements, as well as Northam’s potential financial exposure under the guarantee it provided to holders of
     Zambezi preference shares, should the guarantee be called upon. Furthermore, should Zambezi redeem
     the Zambezi preference shares through a distribution of ordinary shares in Northam (“Northam shares”)
     held by Zambezi, then the redemption of the Zambezi preference shares held by Northam at such time will
     result in a distribution of Northam shares to Northam, thereby reducing the number of Northam shares in
     issue.

     The ZPLP acquisition has been fully funded through the placement of the new notes, as further detailed
     below.

     The ZPLP acquisition is not a categorised transaction in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements
     and information relating thereto is provided for information purposes only.

2.   INCREASE IN NORTHAM’S DMTN PROGRAMME AMOUNT FROM R5 BILLION TO R10 BILLION

     In terms of the programme memorandum in respect of Northam's ZAR5 000 000 000 Domestic Medium
     Term Note Programme dated 3 August 2012, as amended and / or supplemented from time to time
     (“DMTN Programme”), the board of directors of Northam has approved an increase in the Programme                                                                                                       
     Nominal Amount from ZAR5 000 000 000 to ZAR10 000 000 000. This increase will provide Northam with
     additional funding flexibility.

3.   PLACEMENT OF R1.27 BILLION OF NEW NOTES

     Northam is pleased to announce that it has completed a private placement of notes to the value of
     R1.27 billion (“new notes”) under its DMTN Programme, in an amount equal to the consideration payable
     under the ZPLP acquisition. The new notes were placed as a new tranche under the NHM014 series and
     were listed on the Interest Rate Market of the JSE today, 3 April 2020. The new notes were issued on the
     same terms as the NHM014 series with a maturity date of 20 November 2021 and a floating interest rate of
     3 month ZAR-JIBAR plus 2.5%, with interest payable quarterly. Following the placement of the new notes,
     the total aggregate nominal amount of notes in issue under the DMTN Programme amounts to R5.445
     billion.

Financial results

Normalised headline earnings have been calculated taking into account the headline earnings adjusted for
items relating to the 2015 Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited black economic empowerment transaction (""BEE
transaction""); these include the preference share dividends associated with the BEE financing structure
as well as the loss on derecognition of the preference share liability. Stripping out the impact of the BEE
transaction resulted in normalised headline earnings increasing to R1.9 billion (H1 F2019: R553.3 million),
which equates to normalised earnings per share, based on the total number of 509 781 212 issued shares,
of 369.6 cents (H1 F2019: 108.5 cents), being an increase of 240.6%.

Sales revenue increased by 57.0% from R5.0 billion in H1 F2019 to R7.8 billion in the period under review.
The increase is attributable to an 11.9% increase in the volume of PGMs sold to 329 760 oz 4E (H1 F2019:
294 823 oz 4E), a 42.4% increase in the 4E basket price to USD1 443/oz (H1 F2019: USD1 013/oz) and a
3.7% weaker average ZAR/USD exchange rate realised of R14.72 (H1 F2019: R14.19).

A 23.1% increase in cost of sales and corresponding 57.0% increase in revenue resulted in operating profit
increasing to R3.0 billion (H1 F2019: R1.0 billion), an all-time high for the group. This translates to an
operating profit margin of 37.8%.

It is the first time since 2015 that the group has generated meaningful free cash flow after funding capital
expenditure. This amounted to R695.8 million (H1 F2019: utilisation of R185.6 million).

It is expected that the group's ability to generate free cash flow in the foreseeable future will be positively
impacted by production growth and the continuing increase in Platinum Group Metal prices.

The board of directors of Northam (""board"") has resolved not to declare an interim dividend for the 2020
financial year (H1 F2019: R Nil per share). The board is currently of the view that the most efficient way to
return value to shareholders is by way of the purchase of Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited preference shares.

TRADING STATEMENT

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, companies are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they are satisfied, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the financial
results for the current reporting period (H1 F2020) will differ by at least 20% from the financial results of
the previous corresponding period (H1 F2019).

Northam expects to achieve a record operating profit for the six months ended 31 December 2019,
underpinned by a solid operating performance at all operations and a higher basket price received. The
group achieved a record production from own operations amounting to 306 738 4E oz, representing a

* Used to determine the basic and headline earnings per share, calculated as 509 781 212 shares in issue less
159 905 453 shares held by Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (Zambezi). Zambezi is Northam's major empowerment
shareholder and Zambezi's financial results are consolidated into the group's financial results.

The group expects normalised headline earnings (defined as the group's headline earnings adjusted for
the impact of Northam's black economic empowerment transaction), which constitutes the group's main
measure of performance, to be in excess of R1.8 billion (H1 F2019: R553.3 million), representing an
increase in excess of 240% from H1 F2019.

During the period under review, Northam returned value to shareholders by acquiring 32.5 million
Zambezi preference shares (representing 20.3% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue) for
R2.4 billion. Northam now holds 22.9% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue, whilst maintaining a net
debt to EBITDA ratio of 1 to 1.

The financial information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by
Northam's auditors. The condensed reviewed interim results for the six months ended 31 December 2019
are expected to be published on or about 28 February 2020.

Proceeds from the New Notes will be applied by Northam towards the recommissioning and development of
Northam's Eland mine, consequently creating new employment opportunities in the region.


Following the placement of the New Notes, the total nominal value of Notes in issue under the Programme will
amount to R4.175 billion.


Paul Dunne, Northam's chief executive, said: ""Northam is delighted to have the IDC as a long-term funding
partner in the development of its Eland mine and values the IDC's commitment to job creation in the PGM sector.
The IDC funding will contribute towards Eland mine capital expenditure and the 5 year commitment provides
Northam with significant long-term funding certainty.""
