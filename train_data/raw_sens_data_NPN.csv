NASPERS’S SUBSIDIARY PROSUS ANNOUNCES LAUNCH OF SHARE REPURCHASE AND SHARE PURCHASE


Shareholders are referred to the announcement issued by Naspers’s subsidiary Prosus N.V.
(Prosus) today in respect of the launch of:

   •   an on-market Prosus ordinary share N repurchase programme of up to US$1.37 billion
       from its free-float shareholders (the Share Repurchase); and

   •   an on-market Naspers Limited (Naspers) N ordinary share purchase programme of
       up to US$3.63 billion (the Share Purchase, together with the Share Repurchase, the
       Transaction).

The board of directors of Prosus (the Prosus Board) is of the view that the Transaction is,
among other things, an investment in the group’s current strong internet portfolio, which is
a sensible use of capital given full market valuations in consumer tech M&A, and the sizeable
discount to the group’s net asset value (NAV). Prosus has a track record of generating good
returns by investing across the consumer internet space. Prosus also takes a long-term
approach to capital allocation across its operations, investments, and this approach now
extends to its asset base – directly and indirectly via its own stock. The Prosus Board believes
that the Transaction will generate value for its shareholders.

Prosus has appointed intermediaries to execute the Transaction within parameters set by it,
allowing the execution of (re)purchases in the open market during open and closed periods.
These intermediaries will make their trading decisions independently from, and uninfluenced
by, Prosus and Naspers.

The Share Purchase will commence on 24 November 2020 and end on 26 November 2021, or
sooner if the maximum consideration under the Share Purchase is reached before then.

The Naspers N ordinary shares held by Prosus after having been purchased under the Share
Purchase will constitute treasury shares under the JSE Listings Requirements. Prosus intends
not to exercise any voting rights attaching to the Naspers N ordinary shares acquired under
the Share Purchase.

The Share Purchase will be implemented in accordance with, and subject to, applicable law
and regulations, as well as the authorities granted by the general meeting of shareholders of
Naspers dated 21 August 2020, as it may be renewed.

The Share Purchase by Prosus constitutes a general repurchase of securities under the JSE
Listings Requirements and will be implemented accordingly.

Statement by the directors of Naspers

Having regard to the decision of the Prosus Board to implement the Share Purchase and after
considering the effects of the Transaction by Prosus, pursuant to the JSE Listings
Requirements the board of directors of Naspers states that:
                                                                                             
    -    Naspers and its group will be able, in the ordinary course of business, to pay their
         debts as they become due for a period of 12 months following the date of this
         announcement;

    -    the assets of Naspers and its group will be in excess of the liabilities of Naspers and
         its group for a period of 12 months following the date of this announcement;

    -    the share capital and reserves of Naspers and its group will be adequate for ordinary
         business purposes for a period of 12 months following the date of this announcement;

    -    the working capital of Naspers and its group will be adequate for ordinary business
         purposes for a period of 12 months following the date of this announcement; and

    -    Naspers and its group have passed the solvency and liquidity test envisaged in the
         South African Companies Act, 2008, as amended, and since the test was performed
         there have been no material changes to the financial position of the Naspers group.

Interim results announcement
for the six months ended 30 September 2020

COMMENTARY
September 2020 marked the first anniversary of the listing of Prosus on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. 
This created Europe's largest consumer internet company and a new investment opportunity on the global technology 
stage, improving the group's access to international internet investors. A year on, ownership of Prosus continues 
to expand and diversify. The group's recent inclusion in Europe's leading index, the Euro Stoxx 50, is expected to 
attract additional European investor interest over time.

Given the wide geographical span of our operations and significant mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity in
ecommerce, reported earnings are materially impacted by foreign exchange movements and the effects of acquisitions and
disposals. Where relevant in this report, we have adjusted for these effects. These adjustments (pro forma financial 
information) are quoted in brackets after the equivalent metrics reported under International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS). 

The earnings for the period ended 30 September 2020 compared to 30 September 2019 are impacted by the contribution
from the Prosus group post its listing and creation of the free float resulting in a significant non-controlling 
interest of the group. As at 30 September 2019 we recognised 100% of the earnings compared to 72.66% in the 
current period.

The following segmental reviews are prepared on an economic-interest basis (which include consolidated subsidiaries
and a proportionate consolidation of associates and joint ventures), unless otherwise stated.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
The group delivered good results for the first six months ended 30 September 2020, despite Covid-19. Group revenue,
measured on an economic-interest basis, was US$13.0bn, reflecting growth of 27% (32%), a meaningful acceleration of 16pp
(12pp) over the same period last year. Ecommerce revenues grew 37% (52%) year on year. Tencent grew revenues by a healthy
27% (28%). Group trading profit grew 38% (42%) to US$2.6bn. Tencent's contribution to the group's trading profit
improved 31% (32%).  

Core headline earnings were US$1.6bn - down 6% (5%). Core headline earnings are largely impacted by reduced earnings
contributions in the current year from the Prosus group, post its listing in September 2019 and the creation of the free
float resulting in a significant non-controlling interest of the group. As at 30 September 2019 we recognised 100% of
the Prosus earnings compared to 72.66% in the current period. The non-controlling interest share in the core headline
earnings for the period is US$591m. We refer shareholders to the separate Prosus condensed consolidated interim financial
statements which are free of the impacts outlined in this paragraph and outline the good increases in headline earnings
and core headline earnings delivered by the group's operations. We remind shareholders that Prosus represents most of 
the group's operations. Overall, core headline earnings reflect strong performance of the group, driven by improved
profitability from our Ecommerce units and the growing contribution from Tencent.

We ended the period with a strong and liquid balance sheet. We had a net cash position of US$4.6bn, comprising
US$10.3bn in cash and cash equivalents (including short-term cash investments), net of US$5.7bn in interest-bearing debt
(excluding capitalised lease liabilities). We hold an undrawn US$2.5bn revolving credit facility. Overall, we recorded 
net interest expense for the period of US$41m. 

In July 2020, Prosus, Naspers's 72.66%-owned subsidiary, successfully raised more than US$2bn in debt, comprising its
longest-dated US dollar offering to date and its debut euro notes offering. The offerings drew strong investor demand,
resulting in attractive pricing that reduced the group's average funding cost while extending the blended maturity
profile of its outstanding notes to almost 12 years. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including
future M&A activity, and to further augment the company's liquidity. Issuances consisted of 2050 US$1bn 4.027% notes, 
2028 Euro500m 1.593% notes and 2032 Euro500m 2.031% notes. The group has no debt maturities due until 2025. 

Consolidated free cash inflow was US$292m, a significant improvement on the prior year's free cash inflow of US$19m.
This reflects growth in our Ecommerce unit's profitability, dividends received from Tencent of US$458m (2019: US$377m)
and improved working capital management. 

There were no new or amended accounting pronouncements effective from 1 April 2020 with a significant impact on the
group's condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

Effective 1 April 2020, the group made a voluntary change to its accounting policy on the subsequent measurement of
written put option arrangements with non-controlling shareholders. Subsequent changes in the carrying value of put option
liabilities previously recognised in the income statement in ""Other finance income/(costs) - net"" are now recognised
through equity. We believe the change in accounting policy will provide more relevant information about the effects of
underlying transactions with non-controlling shareholders. Written put option arrangements are considered equity
transactions because the settlement with non-controlling shareholders does not result in losing control over a subsidiary.
Furthermore, on initial recognition of the written put option liability, the group simultaneously recognises the 
non-controlling interest because the risks and rewards of ownership are not deemed to have transferred to the group 
until the written put option liability is settled. 

The group has adopted this change in accounting policy retrospectively, however, the impact is insignificant to the
consolidated statement of financial position as all previous remeasurements recognised through the income statement 
are already accumulated in equity as at the effective date of the change. The previous remeasurements accumulated in 
retained earnings have been reclassified to the ""existing control business combination reserve"". Consequently, comparative
figures on the statement of financial position have been restated for the reclassification between retained earnings and 
other reserves. The carrying value of the written put option liabilities and the total equity of the group in the comparative
periods remain unchanged. The condensed consolidated income statement and finance income/costs note have been restated
for the remeasurement of written put option liabilities as these are now recognised directly in equity. 

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in this interim results
announcement.

We continue to explore growth opportunities to advance our strategy, expand our ecosystem and position the business
for sustainable growth. In our Classifieds segment, we merged letgo and OfferUp, resulting in a business with national
reach across the United States (US), well positioned for growth in a highly competitive market. The merger included a new
US$120m investment round led by Prosus. Furthermore, we injected our Middle Eastern Classifieds assets into Emerging
Markets Property Group (EMPG) and participated in a US$150m financing round that valued the business at over US$1bn. OLX
Brazil has subsequently completed the US$520m (BRL2.9bn) acquisition of leading real estate vertical Grupo ZAP, announced
in March 2020. In our Payments and Fintech segment, we made an additional investment of US$53m in Remitly to expand its
footprint in the US, United Kingdom (UK) and Canada. We participated in Mail.ru's capital raise to fund growth
initiatives, investing US$25m. Finally, we are focused on increasing our exposure to edtech (educational technology) by 
investing US$60m in Eruditus, a global professional higher-education online platform. In November we announced a total 
investment of US$500m in Churchill Capital Corp II's planned acquisition of Software Luxembourg Holding S.A. (Skillsoft) 
and Global Knowledge Training LLC (Global Knowledge). The transaction will create the world's leading digital learning 
company with a comprehensive suite of on-demand and live virtual content. 

COVID-19
We started the financial year in April 2020 responding to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has proven to be 
a global challenge. Despite the social and economic impact across the world, Naspers remained resilient and performed
well in the first half of the current financial year - accelerating revenue growth, improving profitability and cash 
flow generation, and growing customer numbers as consumers moved online. Ecommerce revenues grew 37% (52%) year on 
year. Group trading profit grew 38% (42%). 

Like most companies, Naspers faced challenges, particularly in countries where government lockdown regulations were
extensive and protracted, reducing economic activity. We quickly implemented our contingency plans and we saw a sharp
recovery in all of our businesses as lockdown regulations began easing.

Throughout the crisis, we prioritised the health and wellbeing of our employees, safeguarded jobs as far as possible,
and protected and positioned our business for the long term. When necessary, we extended support to our partners to
ensure the supply chain remained strong, and donated to government Covid-19 response programmes. 

After the easing of lockdowns and curfews in many countries in the second quarter, almost all business activities have
resumed year-on-year growth. In addition, Tencent remained resilient throughout the pandemic and is performing well.
Unfortunately, a second Covid-19 wave is impacting some markets in which we operate, however, we remain confident that 
the plans we have put in place and our firm financial position will ensure that we manage the potential impacts going
forward. Longer term, we believe we will benefit from the acceleration of the underlying trends to online platforms 
which propel the growth of the consumer internet market, and we will ensure our businesses are positioned to emerge 
well from the crisis.

Trading statement


Shareholders are advised that the Naspers group (“the group”) is finalising its condensed consolidated
interim report for the six months ended 30 September 2020.

As outlined in the table below, the Group is expected to deliver good results for the first half ended
30 September 2020 despite the impacts of Covid-19.

We have completed several acquisitions in the first six months and have continued to explore growth
opportunities to advance our strategy, expand our ecosystem and to position the business for
continued long-term growth.

More details will be published with the condensed consolidated interim financial statements on
Monday, 23 November 2020.

The group has illustrated the anticipated changes in earnings, headline earnings and core headline
earnings per share for the period ended 30 September 2019 as compared to 30 September 2020 in
the tables below:

                                                        30 September 2020

 Earnings per share(1)                   518                (34) – 3             (6.6%) – 0.6%
 Headline earnings per share(1)          326                  67 – 89             20.6% – 27.3%
 Core headline earnings* per             380                (28) – (5)           (7.4%) – (1.3%)
 share(1)

For the period ended 30 September 2020, the group’s earnings, headline earnings and core headline
earnings growth is impacted largely by reduced earnings contributions in the current year from the
Prosus Group, post its listing in September 2019 and the creation of the free-float resulting in a
significant non-controlling interest of the group. As at 30 September 2019 we recognised 100% of the
Prosus earnings compared to 72.66% in the current period. The expected non-controlling interest
share in the core headline earnings for the period would be approximately US$600m. We refer
shareholders to the separate Prosus trading statement which is free of the impacts outlined in this
paragraph and outlines expected increases in headline earnings and core headline earnings of the
group’s operations. We remind shareholders that Prosus represents the majority of the group’s
operations.

Shareholders are reminded that the board considers core headline earnings an appropriate indicator
of the operating performance of the group, as it adjusts for non-operational items. Core headline
earnings per share for the current period is expected to decrease by between 28 and 5 cents per share
(between 7.4% and 1.3%), driven mainly by the creation of the Prosus free float in September 2019
as described above. Adjusted for this, core headline earnings growth per share is expected to increase
in the same range as Prosus, between 23.8% - 30.5%, as illustrated in the Prosus trading statement.

Like most companies, in the period we faced some challenges due to Covid-19, particularly in countries
where government lockdown regulations were wide ranging and long lasting. However, we have seen
a sharp recovery in all of our impacted businesses as our contingency plans produced results once
lockdown regulations began easing. We continue to respond quickly to the evolving Covid-19 situation
to ensure we safeguard our people, maintain our ability to serve our customers and protect our
businesses for the long-term. While forward visibility remains difficult, given the challenges some
countries face in dealing with the longer-term effects of Covid-19, we continue to believe we will
benefit from the acceleration of the trends that have propelled the growth of the consumer internet.

Financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported on
by the company’s auditors.

*Core headline earnings, a non-IFRS performance measure, represent headline earnings for the period, excluding certain non-operating items. Specifically,
headline earnings are adjusted for the following items to derive core headline earnings: (i) equity-settled share-based payment expenses on transactions where
there is no cash cost to the company. These include those relating to share-based incentive awards settled by issuing treasury shares as well as certain share-
based payment expenses that are deemed to arise on shareholder transactions; (ii) deferred taxation income recognised on the first-time recognition of deferred
tax assets, as this generally relates to multiple prior periods and distorts current period performance; (iii) fair-value adjustments on financial instruments and
unrealised currency translation differences, as these items obscure the group's underlying operating performance; (iv) once-off gains and losses (including
acquisition-related costs) resulting from acquisitions and disposals of businesses, as these items relate to changes in the composition of the group and are not
reflective of its underlying operating performance; and (v) the amortisation of intangible assets recognised in business combinations and acquisitions and (vi)
donations made to various governments in assisting with the Covid-19 pandemic, as these expenses are not considered operational in nature. These adjustments
are made to the earnings of combined businesses controlled by the group as well as the group's share of earnings of associates and joint ventures, to the extent
that the information is available.

(1) Per share information is based on the net number of A and N ordinary shares in issue during the respective periods.

NASPERS SUBSIDIARY PROSUS ANNOUNCES ITS INTENTION TO ACQUIRE UP TO
US$5 BILLION OF NASPERS AND PROSUS SHARES

Shareholders are referred to the announcement issued by Naspers’s subsidiary Prosus N.V.
(Prosus) today in respect of its intention to implement:

    •    an on-market Prosus ordinary share N repurchase programme of up to US$1.37 billion
         from its free-float shareholders (the Share Repurchase); and

    •    an on-market Naspers Limited (Naspers) N ordinary share purchase programme of
         up to US$3.63 billion (the Share Purchase, together with the Share Repurchase, the
         Proposed Transaction).

Prosus intends to launch the Proposed Transaction following the release of its results for the
six months ended 30 September 2020, expected to be announced on 23 November 2020.

The Share Purchase by Prosus constitutes a general repurchase of securities under the JSE
Listings Requirements and will be implemented in accordance with, and subject to, the
relevant authorities granted by Naspers shareholders.

The board of directors of Naspers believes the purchase of Naspers N shares and the
repurchase of Prosus ordinary shares N represent a timely investment in the group’s strong
internet portfolio and a sensible use of capital given full market valuations evident in
consumer internet and the group’s sizeable consolidated discount to net asset value.

Summary of statements from the annual general meeting:


A transformational year
This was a truly transformational year: the successful listing of Prosus sets the company on a path to
generating even more value for our stakeholders in the future.


Clear focus and direction
For many years now, we have concentrated on creating value by improving people’s lives around the
world. At heart, we are entrepreneurs who want to make a positive impact. We do this through a
combination of being focused and disciplined, remaining open to opportunity and change, and always
looking to grow and create long-term sustainable value in a responsible way.


We continue to transform our group - investing in new and existing businesses and creating
innovative technology-enabled products and services. As ever, we focus on backing entrepreneurs,
technology and business concepts that meet fundamental human needs. This is at the core of how
we create sustainable value for all our stakeholders.


In our highly dynamic, fast changing, high-growth world, we never lose sight of our commitment to
good governance. We aim to conduct the group’s business with integrity, applying appropriate
corporate governance policies and principles. We are building on our commitment to sustainability
and we continually evaluate where to improve governance.


Strong performance
Naspers ended the year in a position of strength, with accelerating revenue in our e-commerce
portfolio, improved profitability and a substantial net cash position which provides us with ample
liquidity. This is an enviable position during normal times - but it is truly differentiating in today’s
climate. As the world continues to confront the global Covid-19 crisis, some core trends directly
related to our business are accelerating and solidifying. The data that we see shows that consumers
are consistently increasing their online activity and spending. We believe that this change is
structural, so as a 100% online business, we expect Prosus to emerge from the crisis even stronger.


                                                                                                      
Revenue grew 23% year on year, with e-commerce growing 32% to US$4.7 billion, a 6% acceleration
on last year. Profitability improved by (13%)17% even as we significantly stepped up our investment
in Food Delivery. Profitability was mainly driven by Classifieds and Payments & Fintech, which
remained profitable at the core. We are investing further to expand our ecosystem and routes in
both these segments. Excluding the increased investments in Food Delivery, and Payments and
Fintech as well as acquisitions and disposals, ecommerce trading losses reduced by 24% or US$76m in
local currency.


Taking each of our core segments in turn: Classifieds grew revenues 48%(37%) year on year and
trading profit US$44 million despite the step up in the investment to build out our transaction
business, which is growing fast – up 282%(164%) year on year. Our Food Delivery business is scaling
driven by strong demand and order growth. We have also seen signs of improved efficiency and
customer acquisition. Revenue increased 99%(105%) to US$751 million. Trading losses increased to
US$624 million reflecting continued investment in growth. Turning to Payments & Fintech, PayU grew
revenue 19% (21%) year on year. In India, revenue grew even faster at 29%(31%) year over year.
India continues to be a key focus for Ventures - the underlying market drivers represent significant
potential. In the last financial year, we invested in Meesho and ElasticRun, and in the previous year
we invested in BYJU’S. So far, we have invested about US$855 million in our Ventures portfolio. Our
edtech investments, for example in BYJU’s and Brainly, are by a significant margin the largest in the
Ventures portfolio. Covid-19 is accelerating the demand and impact of edtech and this creates an
opportunity for us.


We had another good year with Tencent. The company continued to grow strongly. Our share of
Tencent revenue and trading profit grew 21% and 22% respectively.


Committed to our strategy
We remain firmly committed to our strategy – it is a real differentiator. We are active participants in
our investments and we have become increasingly close to our partners during the crisis, to ensure
we support them. Being both an operator and investor helps us to prioritise and share best practises
at a very concrete level. We always take a long-term view and our focus remains on building
sustainable leadership positions across our core segments. This is key to attaining profitability on a
                                                                                                     6
sustainable basis. Through the year, we invested US$1.3 billion in Food Delivery, Classifieds,
Payments & Fintech, and Ventures. We continue to be highly disciplined in our capital allocation.
During the year we considered over 5,000 potential deals and executed on 54. (We have also walked
away from high profile transactions where it was the right thing to do.)


Commitment to South Africa
Following the Prosus listing, Naspers is still the largest South African company on the JSE. We are one
of the foremost investors in the South African technology sector, with the country’s leading etailer
and its leading print and digital media business. Through Naspers Foundry we aim to invest R1.4bn in
the next generation of outstanding South African tech start-ups in the coming years. And Naspers
Labs is pioneering an innovative hyper-local programme to tackle youth unemployment.


We also continue to contribute significantly in terms of tax: in total, Naspers group paid R13.2bn in
taxes in South Africa during the year. In April 2020 we donated R1.5bn in emergency aid to the
government’s response to the Covid-19 crisis. This comprised R500m to the Solidarity Response Fund
announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa, and R1bn of personal protective equipment and other
medical supplies, which we sourced in China, in partnership with the Chinese government and
Tencent, to support South Africa’s health workers. This included the logistics to fly the equipment to
South Africa and, in conjunction with the South African government, the distribution to medical
facilities across the country.


Aligning remuneration to performance and value creation
We aim to attract, motivate and retain the best people to create sustainable shareholder value. Our
people are at the heart of our success. We operate in a highly competitive global market for the
digital talent we need. To attract and retain the best and achieve our goals, we focus on pay for
performance, encourage ownership and an entrepreneurial spirit in our teams around the world, and
align management compensation with the creation of shareholder value over time.


As a strategic investor and operator we focus on long-term value creation by building leading
technology companies that improve people’s daily lives in high-growth markets. As a global consumer
internet group, we are one of the largest technology investors in the world. Our business moves fast


                                                                                                       
as technology trends and consumer adoption change, and we seek to run businesses that have broad
potential, can address big societal needs and can attain market leadership over time.
Our executives continue to be compensated based on both Naspers and Prosus performance.


This year, 60% of the longer-term incentive awards (LTIs) to senior executives will be made in
performance share units (PSUs), which will vest after three years only if key performance metrics are
met. PSUs, as part of our remuneration toolkit, including share options (SOs) and share appreciation
rights (SARs), create a truly balanced mix of LTIs with value-based performance hurdles that will help
drive the right longer-term outcomes for stakeholders.


Below the executive level, we are using restricted share units (RSUs) more broadly across the
organisation, to better align our compensation practices with our peers and increase opportunity for
employees to own shares in the company. RSUs will be complemented with SAR allocations on our
unlisted assets, to further align incentives to performance delivery and value creation.


Societal fairness is very important to us, particularly as we operate in developing economies where
socioeconomic disparity can be large. We take our responsibilities in that respect seriously and
ensure that our pay practices around the world are fair and competitive. And pay is an important
aspect, but not the only consideration. In general, our people join us because of the opportunity to
do meaningful work where they have the opportunity to make a difference, to learn and grow.


We will continue to engage closely with our stakeholders – listening and responding to feedback and
above all, focusing on strongly aligning our remuneration to Naspers’s strategy and performance.




                                                                                                    
Looking forward with confidence
Our core objectives are unchanged and strong market dynamics underpin our structural growth. We
are clear about where we are heading in the interests of our shareholders and all our stakeholders.
So, the fundamentals are strong and we have real momentum.

FINAL CASH DIVIDEND DECLARATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2020,
NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING AND PUBLICATION OF B-BBEE ANNUAL COMPLIANCE
CERTIFICATE

Dividend declaration

Further to the summarised consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020 as
released on SENS and the company’s website www.naspers.com, the board recommends an annual
gross dividend of 580 cents (2019: 715 cents) per listed N ordinary share, and 116 cents (2019: 143
cents) per unlisted A ordinary share.

In determining the proposed N ordinary share dividend, the board considered that shareholders who
held listed N ordinary shares last year at the time of listing Prosus would have received shares in Prosus
or additional shares in Naspers Limited. These, if they continued to hold those shares, would entitle
them to receive either an additional Prosus dividend of 11 euro cents (South African rand equivalent
to be determined at the time of payment, currently 213 South African cents, based on exchange rate
at 26 June 2020) per share, or dividends on their additional Naspers N ordinary shares received. The
combined Naspers and Prosus dividend represents an increase of around 10% on the prior-year
Naspers dividend per share. The Prosus summarised consolidated financial statements for the year
ended 31 March 2020, final dividend declaration and details of the publication of the annual report
was released on SENS today, Monday, 29 June 2020, copies of which are available on the website
www.prosus.com.

If confirmed by shareholders at the annual general meeting on Friday 21 August 2020, dividends will
be payable to shareholders recorded in the books on Friday 27 November 2020 and paid on Monday
30 November 2020. The last date to trade cum dividend will be on Tuesday 24 November 2020 (shares
trade ex-dividend from Wednesday 25 November 2020). Share certificates may not be dematerialised
or rematerialised between Wednesday 25 November 2020 and Friday 27 November 2020, both dates
inclusive. The dividend will be declared from income reserves.

It will be subject to the dividend tax rate of 20%, yielding a net dividend of 464 cents per listed N
ordinary share and 95.2 cents per unlisted A ordinary share to those shareholders not exempt from
paying dividend tax. Dividend tax will be 116 cents per listed N ordinary share and 20.8 cents per
unlisted A ordinary share.

The issued ordinary share capital as at 29 June 2020 was 435 511 058 N ordinary shares and 961 193
A ordinary shares. The company’s income tax reference number is 9550138714. All figures in South
African cents unless stated otherwise.
Distribution of integrated annual report and notice of annual general meeting

Shareholders are advised that the company’s integrated annual report (including the notice and proxy
of the annual general meeting) and annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020 will
be posted on the company’s website www.naspers.com this evening, Monday 29 June 2020.

notice is hereby given that the 106th annual general meeting of the company will be held at 14:00 on

Commentary
The past financial year has seen the Naspers group transform as we executed several significant strategic initiatives,
which we believe will unlock value over time. Operationally, the group ended the year in a position of strength with
accelerating revenue growth in its ecommerce (online commerce) portfolio, improved profitability and a substantial net
cash position with sufficient liquidity. Underpinning these results, Tencent continued to report resilience in an uncertain
macro-environment. Most recently, the onset of a global pandemic has had a marked impact on the daily lives of people
globally and the economy at large. While the impact is likely to persist for some time, we are confident to weather the
storm. The group's focus is on safety, plus leveraging its financial flexibility to continue building a business that
grows strongly, generates high rates of return and provides employment for thousands over the long term. 

After many years of stock-price outperformance, Naspers now represents an outsized position on the JSE Limited's
shareholder weighted index (SWIX). To extend our shareholder base and reduce that outsized position, on 11 September
2019, we listed our international internet assets on Euronext Amsterdam as Prosus N.V. (Prosus). Prosus includes all
Naspers's operations and investments outside South Africa in online classifieds, food delivery, payments and fintech 
(financial technology), etail (online retail), travel, education, and social and internet platforms. As Europe's most 
valuable consumer internet company, Prosus gives global internet investors direct access to our portfolio of international 
internet assets, as well as exposure to China, India and other high-growth markets. Prosus also has a secondary listing 
on the JSE Limited in South Africa. At the date of listing, Prosus was 73.84% owned by Naspers, with a free float of 26.16%. 
In January 2020, to fulfil an obligation to the South African Reserve Bank to repatriate US$1.5bn to South Africa, Naspers 
sold 22 million shares in Prosus, representing 1.35% of the issued Prosus N ordinary shares to institutional investors for 
gross proceeds of €1.5bn (US$1.64bn). Following the disposal, Prosus was 72.49% owned by Naspers with a free float of 27.51%.
We have no intention to sell additional shares of Prosus. 

All proceeds, net of expenses and costs, received by Naspers from this disposal were repatriated to South Africa as
required and used to return capital to our shareholders in the form of a share repurchase programme. This was completed 
on 24 March 2020, with a total of 9 156 705 Naspers N ordinary shares being repurchased (representing 2.06% of the issued
Naspers N ordinary shares prior to the programme). A total of R22.4bn (US$1.4bn), including transaction costs, was paid
(representing an average cost of R2 447.11 per Naspers N ordinary share). The Naspers N ordinary shares repurchased have
been cancelled and delisted. We are pleased with the outcome which, through the sale of Prosus N ordinary shares with a
lower discount to net asset value and repurchase of Naspers N ordinary shares with a larger discount to net asset
value, realised around R3.3bn in shareholder value. As a result, Naspers had 435 511 058 N ordinary shares in issue at 
31 March 2020.

We ended the financial year facing the global Covid-19 pandemic, with many of our markets locking down in March 2020.
Our priority was the wellbeing of our 25 000 people and the communities we serve around the world. As a global company
operating in numerous local markets we take our responsibility seriously. We are helping our people and communities
navigate this crisis. In April 2020, we committed R1.5bn (US$84m) in emergency aid to the South African government's 
response to the crisis. We contributed R500m to the Solidarity Fund announced by the South African president, plus 
R1bn worth of personal protective equipment and other medical supplies. This equipment was rapidly sourced - in partnership 
with the Chinese government and Tencent - to support South Africa's frontline health workers. It was delivered in multiple
shipments, with the final shipment delivered on 12 June 2020. Prosus also donated INR100crore (US$13m) to the Indian
government's response to the Covid-19 crisis via the Prime Minister's Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations 
Fund. In addition, at local level, many of our companies have made meaningful contributions. Across the group, we continue 
to identify ways in which our technological expertise, global networks and resources can be used to support the fight
against this virus. 

We will continue to respond quickly to the evolving situation to safeguard our people, maintain our ability to serve
our customers and protect our businesses. While we believe each of our segments will continue to benefit from secular
growth trends, the global pandemic has affected operations and we need to draw attention to its potential impacts on 
2021's financial year. That said, we believe the fundamentals of our businesses remain strong. We have sufficient  
liquidity to run the company and the ability to invest in opportunities that may arise during this period.

Group revenue, measured on an economic-interest basis, was US$22.1bn, reflecting growth of 17% (23%) from continuing
operations. Measured similarly, and including the stepped-up investment in Food Delivery, group trading profit grew 
13% (17%) year on year to US$3.7bn. Tencent grew revenues by a healthy 16% (21%) year on year. Driven by Classifieds, 
Etail, and Payments and Fintech, the ecommerce business posted strong performance. Overall revenue growth in ecommerce,
adjusted for acquisitions and disposals, grew 32% in local currency, a 6% acceleration year on year. This was led by the 
Food Delivery segment, which grew orders 102% and revenues by 99% (105%), and strong growth in Classifieds, up 48% (37%).
Tencent's profitability improved 17% (22%). Trading losses in ecommerce rose to US$964m, reflecting our investment in 
Food Delivery to grow markets and sustain our leading positions. Excluding the increased investments in Food Delivery, 
and Payments and Fintech as well as acquisitions and disposals, ecommerce trading losses reduced by 24% or US$76m in 
local currency.

Core headline earnings from continuing operations were US$2.9bn - down 5% (1%). Improving profitability in Tencent and
the more established ecommerce businesses were partially offset by increased taxation related to the Prosus investment.
Through listing Prosus and the subsequent sale of additional shares, minority shareholders with a 27.51% interest in
Prosus were introduced. This reduced the attributable share of Naspers shareholders in the Prosus core headline earnings
contribution for the year ended March 2020 by US$466m (2019: US$nil).

Across the group, we invested US$1.3bn to expand our ecosystem and reach. Notably: through PayU, an investment of
US$66m in Wibmo to expand our Indian footprint in payment security, mobile payment solutions and processing services; an
investment of US$163m in PaySense broadens our ecosystem in India as we now start to offer consumer credit, an investment
of US$199m in Iyzico, a leading payment service provider in Turkey, and US$48m in Red Dot Payment (Red Dot), providing
payment solutions in Singapore and expanding across Southeast Asia. In Classifieds, we acquired a controlling stake in
Frontier Car Group for US$320m and the contribution of certain subsidiaries, expanding our transactions business. Ventures
invested US$81m in Meesho Inc., a leading social commerce online marketplace in India, continuing our successful track
record of identifying Indian opportunities with the potential to become large businesses. We are also increasing our
exposure to the edtech (educational technology) businesses by investing a further US$25m and US$44m in our education
associates Brainly and Udemy respectively. In the Food Delivery business, we invested a further US$100m in our 
associate Swiggy.

At year-end, we had a solid net cash position of US$4.8bn, comprising US$8.3bn of cash and cash equivalents (including
short-term cash investments), net of US$3.5bn of interest-bearing debt (excluding capitalised lease liabilities). We
also have an undrawn US$2.5bn revolving credit facility. Overall, we recorded net interest income of US$16m for the year.
In December 2019, Prosus established a US$6bn global medium-term note programme. In terms of this programme, Prosus may
periodically issue notes denominated in any currency, with a maximum outstanding aggregate nominal amount of US$6bn. 
The notes trade on the Euronext Dublin stock exchange. Under the programme, in January 2020, we successfully issued
US$1.250bn 3.68% notes due in 2030. The purpose of this offering was to raise proceeds to redeem the US$1.0bn 6.00% notes 
due in July 2020. The principal and interest accrued to the maturity date of these notes were repaid in February 2020. 
The group has no debt maturities due until 2025.

Consolidated free cash outflow was US$383m, compared to the prior-year outflow of US$120m from continuing operations
(excluding the Video-Entertainment segment). This change reflects increased investment in the Food Delivery business, 
as well as negative working-capital effects, offset by merchant cash timing differences of US$28m, and transaction costs 
of unbundling MultiChoice Group and listing Prosus of around US$113m. Dividend income received from Tencent increased
US$35m to US$377m. Cash extractions from our profitable Classifieds businesses continued to grow, increasing US$70m to
US$305m. Covid-19 may have a short-term impact on that trajectory, but the positive trend is expected to return.

We adopted the new accounting standard IFRS 16 Leases on a prospective basis. Accordingly, comparative information has
not been restated.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in this short-form announcement.

Trading statement


Shareholders are advised that the Naspers group (“the group”) is finalising its summarised consolidated financial statements
and consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020.

We ended the financial year facing into the global Covid-19 pandemic, with many of our markets entering lockdown in the last
two weeks of March 2020. We continue to respond quickly to the evolving Covid-19 situation to ensure we safeguard our
people, maintain our ability to serve our customers and protect our businesses for the long-term.

During the year ended 31 March 2020, all key ecommerce segments made good progress against financial and strategic
objectives. Classifieds again grew considerably faster than many of its peers and increased profits. Payments and Fintech
segments have now reached profitability at their core and continue to grow profits, while also investing to drive future growth.
Food Delivery was a key investment area during the year as we seek to grow the market and our position in it by investing in
technology and building out our first-party delivery capabilities, city and restaurant reach. Initial results are highly encouraging
as, to date, this investment has driven significant order and revenue growth in our Food Delivery operations. The progress of
our core ecommerce segments, which are growing fast and scaling well, gives us confidence in our ability to continue identifying
opportunities to create significant value into the future. Tencent delivered a solid financial performance. Further details will
be provided in the summarised consolidated financial results, due for release on 29 June 2020.

While we believe each of our segments will continue to benefit from secular growth trends, the global pandemic has negatively
impacted some operations and we need to caution against the potential impacts of Covid-19 on the 31 March 2021 financial
year. That said, it is important to note that the fundamentals of our businesses remain very strong and we believe that we are
well positioned to weather this unprecedented storm. We have sufficient liquidity to provide our businesses with the
appropriate level of funding as well as invest in external opportunities that may present themselves during this period.

After many years of strong growth and stock price outperformance, Naspers has come to represent a very significant and
overweight position on the JSE Limited’s Shareholder Weighted Index (SWIX). In an effort to extend our shareholder base and
reduce that overweight position, on 11 September 2019 the group listed its international internet assets on Euronext
Amsterdam. This listing created the largest listed consumer internet company in Europe, Prosus N.V. (Prosus), comprising the
group’s internet interests outside of South Africa. Prosus also has a secondary, inward listing on the JSE in South Africa. Prosus
is currently 72.49% owned by Naspers.

As a result of the listing of Prosus, the group’s earnings, headline earnings and core headline earnings for the year ended 31
March 2020 are expected to reduce as compared to the year ago period, reflecting the fact that the group will only recognise
a 72.63% contribution from Prosus for the year as compared to a 100% contribution in the prior year period.

Growth in earnings per share in the current period is expected to be reduced as a consequence of:
    -    A gain of approximately US$600m recognised on disposal of the group’s interest in MakeMyTrip Limited, compared
         to a gain of US$1.6bn in the prior period recognised on disposal of the group’s interest in Flipkart Limited. This
         negatively impacts the year-over-year comparison by approximately US$1bn
    -    The aforementioned reduced earnings contribution in the current year from Prosus, post its listing. The expected
         impact of this reduction amounts to approximately US$377m.
    -    US$167m in donations in response to the Covid-19 in March 2020. This comprised US$84m (ZAR1.5 billion) in
         emergency aid provided to the South African government’s response to Covid-19. The group also expensed its
         proportionate share of Covid-19 donations made by Tencent Holdings Limited (Tencent) up to end March 2020 of
         US$83m.

Growth in headline earnings per share in the current period is also negatively impacted by:
       -   Reduced headline earnings contribution from Prosus, post its listing and creation of the free-float. The expected
           impact amounts to approximately US$338m.

       -   Expected fair-value gains on investments held by Tencent (classified as at fair value through profit and loss) of
           approximately US$549m, compared to US$1.5bn recognised in the prior period.

Shareholders are reminded that the board considers core headline earnings an appropriate indicator of the operating
performance of the group, as it adjusts for non-operational items. Core headline earnings per share from continuing operations
for the current period is expected to decrease by between 53 and 8 cents per share (between 8% and 1%). The above
mentioned gains on disposals of investments, fair-value losses and Covid-19 donations have been excluded from core headline
earnings. As such, growth in core headline earnings is expected to be impacted by:

       -   Continued healthy growth from Tencent and the group’s established ecommerce business.

       -   Offset by the additional investment to drive strong growth in the food delivery business; and

       -   The introduction of minority shareholders, through the listing of Prosus and subsequent sale of shares. This is expected
           to reduce the attributable core earnings of Naspers shareholders for the year ended 31 March 2020, by approximately
           US$465m.

In addition, the impact of the MultiChoice Group Limited (MultiChoice Group) listing during the 2019 financial year also
distorted the growth in earnings. The group distributed its interest in its video-entertainment business, MultiChoice Group, to
its shareholders as a pro rata distribution in specie (the distribution). Following the distribution, we present the results of the
video-entertainment segment as discontinued operations in the prior period.

The group has illustrated the anticipated changes in core headline earnings per share, earnings and headline earnings per share
for the year ended 31 March 2019 as compared to 31 March 2020 for both total operations (as previously reported) and
continuing operations in the tables below:

*
  Core headline earnings, a non-IFRS performance measure, represent headline earnings for the period excluding certain non-operating items. Specifically,
headline earnings are adjusted for the following items to derive core headline earnings: (i) equity-settled share-based payment expenses on transactions where
there is no cash cost to the company. These include those relating to share-based incentive awards settled by issuing treasury shares as well as certain share-
based payment expenses that are deemed to arise on shareholder transactions; (ii) deferred taxation income recognised on the first-time recognition of deferred
tax assets as this generally relates to multiple prior periods and distorts current period performance; (iii) fair-value adjustments on financial instruments
(including put option liabilities) and unrealised currency translation differences, as these items obscure the group's underlying operating performance; (iv) one-
off gains and losses (including acquisition-related costs) resulting from acquisitions and disposals of businesses as these items relate to changes in the
composition of the group and are not reflective of its underlying operating performance; (v) the amortisation of intangible assets recognised in business
combinations and acquisitions; and (vi) the donations due to Covid-19, as these expenses are not considered operational in nature. These adjustments are made
to the earnings of businesses controlled by the group as well as the group's share of earnings of associates and joint ventures, to the extent that the information
is available.

(1)
       Per share information is based on the net number of A and N ordinary shares in issue during the respective periods.
(2)
       Weighted average number of shares for the years ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019 have been adjusted to include
       those shares issued for no consideration from the start of the earliest period presented i.e. 1 April 2018, to permit
       comparability in accordance with IAS33 Earnings Per Share. Per share data has accordingly been recalculated for all periods
       presented.
Financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported on by the company’s

Update on impact of COVID-19



   -   Focusing on the health of its employees and communities

   -   Working hard to safeguard customers, partners and businesses

   -   Strong financial position to navigate uncertain times

Today, 8 April 2020, Naspers (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the ""Group"")
provides an update on its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and outlines its actions to
safeguard its employees, customers and businesses as well as to support the communities
in which it operates.

The Group is a global consumer internet group and one of the largest technology investors
in the world. The Group’s businesses serve customers in more than 90 markets. The Group
estimates that approximately one-fifth of the world’s population use products and services
of businesses that the Group has built, acquired or invested in. The Group's diversified
portfolio comprises businesses in high-growth sectors, including food delivery, online
classifieds, payments and fintech, etail, online education, and social and internet
platforms.

Safeguarding its employees, customers and businesses

The Group has monitored COVID-19-related developments in its markets and has
implemented measures to limit the potential spread of the virus among its employees, its
customers and persons connected to its businesses. The Group early-on implemented
work-from-home policies and travel restrictions for its employees to help protect the health
of its employees and those around them. For those employees directly serving customers,
the Group has implemented measures designed to safeguard both them and its customers.
In addition, the Group has implemented measures to support the key partners of its
businesses.

   -   Food delivery: the Group has implemented several initiatives, including iFood
       making available over R$50million in support to restaurants and couriers in Brazil
       affected by COVID-19. In some instances, the Group's businesses have also:
       waived commissions charged by it to restaurants; reduced restaurant payment
       cycles to boost restaurants' liquidity; provided masks, gloves and thermal checks
       for ""delivery-only kitchen"" staff; and provided best practice guidelines for the
       health and safety of restaurant staff and couriers.

   -   Classifieds: the Group has: extended payment and delivery services to more
       categories of users, where possible; offered cameras to users for virtual real estate
       tours; and piloted car inspections by video in some of its automotive businesses.
       To support sellers on some of its marketplaces, the Group has extended the
       duration of listings and provided financial relief to support their ongoing business
       viability.
   -   Payments and fintech: PayU has rolled out a number of initiatives to help
       merchant partners across its markets, including “Startups helping Startups”, which
       allows businesses to collaborate to support COVID-19 efforts. These initiatives
       include collecting donations for hospitals at points-of-sale, and rolling out free
       digital training webinars on how merchants can adapt to trading online.

   -   Etail: eMAG is offering customers alternative ways to receive their purchases.
       These include enabling customers to collect their goods from hundreds of
       conveniently located lockers, which are sanitised multiple times a day, and
       contactless delivery, where drivers deposit packages outside customers’ homes.
       eMAG is also adding new offline retailers to its marketplace to help drive business
       for them. Takealot has also put in place measures to safeguard its employees,
       partners, drivers and customers, including closing Takealot Pickup Points, providing
       contactless delivery and increasing hygiene procedures, guided by international
       best practice and the World Health Organisation (WHO), for all deliveries.

   -   Media: Media24 is committed to supporting South Africa’s response to COVID-19
       by publishing accurate information and keeping the public informed, contributing
       to the spirit of solidarity, compassion and positivity by also telling stories of hope.
       Media24 has implemented additional safety measures and temperature screenings
       at its warehousing and distribution facilities that remain open. In addition,
       enhanced safety measures apply to its journalists working in the field, and its
       distribution employees will adhere to its own measures and the measures
       implemented by its retail partners.

The Group continues to respond to the developing situation, adhering to official guidance
and applicable law and regulation to limit the potential spread of COVID-19.

Supporting the communities in which it operates

The Group is taking action at a group level and at a local company level to support its
communities, particularly where it can use its technological expertise, global networks and
resources to contribute to the response to COVID-19.

   -   Swiggy has launched a campaign to donate meals to persons in need in India. The
       public can also donate to this campaign. The campaign is currently donating
       approximately 35,000 meals per day, with a goal of distributing approximately
       500,000 meals per day in the short-term.

   -   OLX is using its marketplace to help find homes for doctors and arrange
       transportation for the elderly, and is moderating fake advertisements.

   -   Codecademy has awarded 85,000 free scholarships to learners in more than 80
       countries to the Pro version of its course catalogue, and BYJU’S has offered its
       learning platform for free in India.

Naspers is contributing ZAR1.5 billion in emergency aid to the South African government’s
response to COVID-19. Naspers was founded in South Africa over 100 years ago and it is
committed to working with the South African government and civil society to help
overcome the impact of COVID-19 and make a difference in the country. Naspers will
contribute ZAR500 million to the Solidarity Response Fund and will buy ZAR1 billion worth
of personal protective equipment and other medical supplies in China and fly these to
South Africa. Media24 has pledged a contribution of ZAR1 million to the Fund.

The Group continues to encourage the entrepreneurial and innovative spirit of its local
teams to identify additional opportunities to put its capabilities and expertise to work
across the world.

                                                                                            
Business and financial impact

The Group's leadership team is in communication with its businesses to anticipate the
impact of COVID-19 on operations. It is still too early to estimate the scope of any impact
on the Group's operations and financial information, particularly in view of rising global
infections and evolving government responses to the outbreak. The size of the impact on
operations will vary across sector and geography. The Group intends to continue to invest
in its businesses to position them for future recovery.

Importantly, the Group believes that it faces this challenging period from a position of
relative financial strength and with sufficient liquidity to both navigate the changing
environment and seek out new opportunities. The Group closed its financial year on 31
March 2020 with more than US$4 billion in net cash and a US$2.5 billion undrawn revolving
credit facility in place. Prosus's bond offering in January 2020 successfully priced US$1.25
billion 3.680% notes (due 2030) to raise proceeds to redeem its US$1.0 billion 6.000%
notes that are due in July 2020. The Group has no debt maturities due until 2025.

  -   The Group's largest investment, Tencent, continues to grow off a very large base
      and in a market, China, which appears to be emerging relatively well from the impact
      of COVID-19.

  -   In classifieds, the Group has seen a decline in traffic to its marketplaces. The
      Group, however, has taken a number of steps to assist customers and partners
      during this time. In the short-term, the Group expects to experience a negative
      impact on revenue and profitability in its Classifieds businesses.

  -   In payments and fintech, the Group's European businesses appear to be resilient.
      That, however, may change. It remains too early to estimate the impact of the
      recent lockdown in India on its Payments and Fintech business. India represents
      more than 50% of its Payments and Fintech business's transaction volume in
      payments and has initially seen a significant drop in transaction volume. In time,
      the payments and fintech business is expected to benefit across its markets from
      large sectoral trends, including more customers transacting online and more online
      transactions being executed through alternative forms of payment (rather than
      cash).

  -   In food delivery, while the Group is experiencing an increased demand for food
      delivery across its portfolio, it has not always been able to meet that demand due
      to supply issues as restaurants close. In India, Swiggy is permitted to continue to
      operate during the lockdown in India. The lockdown in India has, however, not been
      implemented uniformly across the country and Swiggy's service has been halted in
      some regions. Swiggy is engaging with the national and regional authorities in India
      to ensure the uniform implementation of the lockdown. In Brazil, iFood’s efforts to
      assist its restaurant and food delivery partners has helped mitigate some of the
      supply issues and, at this stage, order volume is holding up well. In South-Africa,
      although food delivery is allowed as an essential service, restaurants and their
      kitchens are barred from operating thereby limiting the items that Mr D Food can
      deliver. Mr D Food is, however, continuing to operate in a limited capacity through
      the delivery of essential goods, where it will use contactless delivery and hygiene
      protocols to ensure safety. In the longer-term, the Group believes that it is possible
      that the current environment may drive a structural shift in global consumption
      patterns in favour of food delivery.

  -   In etail, eMAG’s main market of operation, Romania, entered a lockdown on 26
      March 2020, however, the business is holding up well at this stage. In South Africa,
      Takealot has been impacted by a restriction on certain categories of goods that it
      can sell. Takealot had ceased trading in compliance with the full lockdown. As of the
      evening of Monday, 30 March 2020, Takealot.com, however, has reopened for the
      sale and delivery of essential goods. Takealot has put in place precautionary
      measures to prevent non-essential goods passing through the checkout process, and
      stock and price limitations on key essential goods. It is too early to estimate the size
      of the impact of such lockdown. Takealot has already enacted plans to broaden its
      offering into the non-restricted categories of goods, which are expected to mitigate
      such impact.

  -   In media, the South African government has included the majority of media formats
      as essential services that are allowed to continue operations during the full
      lockdown. As a leading media company in South Africa, Media24 continued with its
      24/7 news coverage and its viewership has increased since the onset of COVID-19.
      Additionally, Media24 is expected to continue to publish a number of its print
      newspapers and magazines for as long as it is practical to do so. The distribution
      footprint of such newspapers and magazines, however, has been reduced to comply
      with the full lockdown.

  -   All of the Group's businesses have continuity plans in place. The Group is actively
      assessing potential impacts and supporting its businesses as they take appropriate,
      market-specific action as needed. The challenges of COVID-19 will vary by sector
      and geography, but the Group believes it has the teams, the resources and the
      experience required to navigate them successfully. The Group believes it will emerge
      from this period well-placed to continue to deliver long-term growth in the markets
      it serves.

To give further context to the impacts of COVID-19 on the Group's businesses,
the Group invites stakeholders to attend a conference call tomorrow, Thursday,
9 April 2020 at 15:00 CET. To access the call please pre-register here. Once
registered, participants will be provided with the information needed to join the
conference, including the dial-in numbers and a passcode. It is also
recommended that participants dial-in 5 to 10 minutes prior to the start time to
ensure sufficient opportunity for assistance, should it be required. The recording
of the call will be made available on the website, www.naspers.com.

RESULTS OF THE SALE BY NASPERS LIMITED OF 22 MILLION N ORDINARY SHARES OF
PROSUS N.V. THROUGH AN ACCELERATED BOOKBUILD OFFERING TO INSTITUTIONAL
INVESTORS

Naspers Limited (""Naspers"") has sold 22 million N ordinary shares (the ""Prosus N Ordinary
Shares"") in Prosus N.V. (""Prosus""), corresponding to c. 1.4% of the issued Prosus N Ordinary
Shares, at a price per Prosus N Ordinary Share of €67.50, resulting in gross proceeds of
approximately €1.5 billion for Naspers. The sale was effected through an accelerated bookbuild
offering to institutional investors (the ""Placing""). Following the Placing, Naspers holds c. 72.5%
of the issued Prosus ordinary shares.

Settlement of the Placing is expected to occur on 24 January 2020 (i.e., on a T+2 basis) on
Euronext Amsterdam.

As part of the Placing and in line with market practice for placements of this nature, Naspers has
agreed to a 90-day lock-up period with respect to its remaining interest in the Prosus N Ordinary
Shares, subject to customary exceptions and an ability to waive by the Joint Global Coordinators.

None of the proceeds raised from the Placing will be received by Prosus, and all of the proceeds
received by Naspers, net of expenses and costs, will be repatriated to South Africa as required
by the South African Reserve Bank. Naspers intends to use these net proceeds over time to
return capital to Naspers shareholders in the form of a share repurchase programme.

IMPORTANT REGULATORY NOTICE

This announcement is not for publication, distribution or release, directly or indirectly, in or into
the United States of America (""United States"" or ""U.S."") (including its territories and
possessions, any state of the United States and the District of Columbia), or to U.S. persons as
defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act (as defined below), or into Canada, Australia or
Japan or any other jurisdiction where such an announcement would be unlawful. The distribution
of this announcement may be restricted by law in certain jurisdictions and persons into whose
possession this document or other information referred to herein comes should inform
themselves about and observe any such restriction. Any failure to comply with these restrictions
may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

The securities referred to herein have not been and will not be registered under the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), and may not be offered or sold
directly or indirectly, in or into the United States or to U.S. persons as defined in Regulation S
under the Securities Act except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject
to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Any offer or sale of the securities referred
to herein in the United States will be made only to persons who are both “qualified institutional
buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act and “qualified purchasers” as defined
in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Neither this document nor the
information contained herein constitutes or forms part of an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an
offer to buy, securities in the United States. There will be no public offer of any securities in the
United States or in any other jurisdiction.

In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area (each a ""Member State""), no
Prosus N Ordinary Shares have been offered or will be offered pursuant to the Placing to the
public in that Member State, except that offers of Prosus N Ordinary Shares may be made to the
public in that Member State at any time under the following exemptions under the Prospectus
Regulation: (a) to any legal entity which is a ""qualified investor"" as defined under the Prospectus
Regulation (a ""Qualified Investor""); (b) to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than
Qualified Investors); or (c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 1(4) of the
Prospectus Regulation, provided that no such offer of Prosus N Ordinary Shares shall require
Naspers, Prosus or any Joint Global Coordinator to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of
the Prospectus Regulation or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus
Regulation. For the purposes of this provision, the expression an ""offer to the public"" in relation
to any Prosus N Ordinary Shares in any Member State means the communication in any form
and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and any Prosus N Ordinary
Shares to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for any
Prosus N Ordinary Shares, and the expression ""Prospectus Regulation"" means Regulation (EU)
2017/1129.

In the United Kingdom, this announcement is being distributed exclusively to, and is directed
exclusively at Qualified Investors who are also: (i) persons having professional experience in
matters relating to investments falling within the definition of “investment professionals” in
Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005,
as amended (the ""Order""); or (ii) persons who are high net worth bodies corporate,
unincorporated associations and partnerships and the trustees of high value trusts, as described
in Article 49(2)(A) to (D) of the Order; or (iii) persons to whom it may otherwise be lawful to
distribute it.

In South Africa, the Placing will only be made by way of separate private placements to: (i)
selected persons falling within one of the specified categories listed in Section 96(1)(a) of the
South African Companies Act, 71 of 2008, as amended (the ""South African Companies Act"");
and (ii) selected persons, acting as principal, acquiring Prosus N Ordinary Shares for a total
acquisition cost of R1,000,000 or more, as contemplated in Section 96(1)(b) of the South African
Companies (""South African Qualifying Investors""). This announcement is only being made
available to such South African Qualifying Investors. Accordingly: (i) the Placing is not an offer
to the public as contemplated in the South African Companies Act; (ii) this announcement does
not, nor does it intend to, constitute a ""registered prospectus"" or ""advertisement"", as
contemplated by the South African Companies Act; and (iii) no prospectus has been filed with
the South African Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (""CIPC"") in respect of the
Placing. As a result, this announcement does not comply with the substance and form
requirements for a prospectus set out in the South African Companies Act and the South African
Companies Regulations of 2011, and has not been approved by, and/or registered with, CIPC.
The information contained in this announcement constitutes factual information as contemplated
in Section 1(3)(a) of the South African Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 37 of
2002, as amended, (the ""South African FAIS Act"") and should not be construed as an express
or implied recommendation, guide or proposal that any particular transaction in respect of the
Naspers N Ordinary Shares or the Prosus N Ordinary Shares or in relation to the business or
future investments of Naspers or Prosus is appropriate to the particular investment objectives,
financial situations or needs of a prospective investor, and nothing in this announcement should
be construed as constituting the canvassing for, or marketing or advertising of, financial services
in South Africa. Neither Naspers nor Prosus is a financial services provider licensed as such under
the South African FAIS Act.

This announcement is not an offer of securities or investments for sale, nor a solicitation of an
offer to buy, securities or investments in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would
be unlawful. No action has been taken that would permit an offering of the securities or
possession or distribution of this announcement in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose
is required. Persons into whose possession this announcement comes are required to inform
themselves about and to observe any such restrictions. No prospectus under the Prospectus
Regulation is required in respect of the Placing and no prospectus, offering circular or similar
document will be prepared.

In connection with the Placing, each of the Joint Global Coordinators and any of their affiliates
acting as an investor for their own account may take up as a proprietary position any Prosus N
Ordinary Shares and in that capacity may retain, purchase or sell for their own account such
Prosus N Ordinary Shares and other securities of Prosus or related investments in connection
with the Placing or otherwise. In addition, each of the Joint Global Coordinators or their affiliates
may enter into financing arrangements (including swaps or contracts for difference) with
investors in connection with each of the Joint Global Coordinators and any of their affiliates may
from time to time acquire, hold or dispose of Prosus N Ordinary Shares. None of the Joint Global
Coordinators or their affiliates intends to disclose the extent of any such investment or
transactions otherwise than in accordance with any legal or regulatory obligation to do so.

Each Joint Global Coordinator is acting on behalf of Naspers and no one else in connection with
the Placing. They will not regard any other person as their client in relation to the Placing and
will not be responsible to anyone other than Naspers for providing the protections afforded to
their respective clients nor for providing advice in relation to the Placing, the contents of this
announcement or any transaction, arrangement or other matter referred to herein. None of the
Joint Global Coordinators or any of their respective subsidiary undertakings, affiliates or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, advisers, agents, alliance partners or any other
entity or person accepts any responsibility or liability whatsoever for, or makes any
representation, warranty or undertaking, express or implied, as to the truth, accuracy,
completeness or fairness of the information or opinions in this announcement (or whether any
information has been omitted from this announcement) or any other information relating to

NASPERS LIMITED LAUNCHES THE SALE OF C. 22 MILLION N ORDINARY SHARES OF
PROSUS N.V. THROUGH AN ACCELERATED BOOKBUILD OFFERING TO
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS


Naspers Limited (""Naspers"") has launched the sale of c. 22 million N ordinary shares (the
""Prosus N Ordinary Shares"") in Prosus N.V. (""Prosus""), corresponding to c. 1.4% of the
issued Prosus N Ordinary Shares, through an accelerated bookbuild offering to institutional
investors (the ""Placing"").

BACKGROUND

On 11 September 2019, Naspers listed its international internet assets on Euronext
Amsterdam under Prosus. These assets comprise its international internet interests outside of
South Africa, including operations and investments in online classifieds, food delivery,
payments and fintech, etail, education, and social and internet platforms. Prosus also has a
secondary, inward listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in South Africa. Prosus is
73.8% owned by Naspers, with a free float of 26.2%. As Europe’s largest listed consumer
internet company by asset value, Prosus gives global internet investors direct access to
Naspers's portfolio of international internet assets through exposure to China, India and other
high-growth markets, as well as to the global tech sector. At the time of the listing, around
US$16 billion of value was unlocked for Naspers's shareholders by reducing the discount to the
combined net asset value of Prosus and Naspers.

PLACING

In the months following the Admission, Naspers has seen significant interest in Prosus from
new investors, in particular European institutions and global technology investors. The Placing
will offer an opportunity to the broad investment community to get exposure to the largest
listed European consumer internet stock by asset value and thereby continue to broaden
Prosus’s shareholder base.

Accordingly, Naspers is offering approximately 22 million Prosus N Ordinary Shares for sale
corresponding to c. 1.4% of the issued Prosus N Ordinary Shares in the Placing. The Placing is
expected to increase Prosus's free-float from c. 26.2% to c. 27.5% with Naspers expected to
hold c. 72.5% of the issued Prosus ordinary shares after the completion of the Placing
(assuming all the Prosus N Ordinary Shares offered in the Placing are placed).

                                                                                             
Institutional investors participating in the Placing will receive Prosus N Ordinary Shares trading
on Euronext Amsterdam in Euro.

The bookbuild will commence immediately following this announcement and Naspers reserves
the right to close the book at any time. Naspers will announce the outcome of the Placing upon
its completion.

As part of the Placing and in line with market practice for placements of this nature, Naspers
has agreed to a 90-day lock-up period with respect to its remaining interest in the Prosus N
Ordinary Shares, subject to customary exceptions and an ability to waive by the Joint Global
Coordinators.

None of the proceeds raised from the Placing will be received by Prosus, and all of the
proceeds received by Naspers, net of expenses and costs, will be repatriated to South Africa as
required by the South African Reserve Bank. Naspers intends to use these net proceeds over
time to return capital to Naspers shareholders in the form of a share repurchase programme.

under the Securities Act except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject
to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Any offer or sale of the securities

Shares shall require Naspers, Prosus or any Joint Global Coordinator to publish a prospectus
pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation or supplement a prospectus pursuant to
Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation. For the purposes of this provision, the expression an
""offer to the public"" in relation to any Prosus N Ordinary Shares in any Member State means
the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the
offer and any Prosus N Ordinary Shares to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to
purchase or subscribe for any Prosus N Ordinary Shares, and the expression ""Prospectus
Regulation"" means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.

In the United Kingdom, this announcement is being distributed exclusively to, and is directed
exclusively at Qualified Investors who are also: (i) persons having professional experience in

""advertisement"", as contemplated by the South African Companies Act; and (iii) no prospectus

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION

On 19 December 2019, Prosus N.V. (Prosus) announced the final increased offer by its wholly-owned
indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) to acquire the entire issued and to be issued
share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Final Increased Offer).

As at 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 10 January 2020 (being the closing date of the Final Increased Offer),
Prosus had received valid acceptances of the Final Increased Offer in respect of 158,037 Just Eat Shares,
representing approximately 0.02 per cent. of the issued share capital of Just Eat. MIH does not own any Just
Eat Shares. As such, the Acceptance Condition has not been satisfied and the Final Increased Offer has
now lapsed.

As the Final Increased Offer has lapsed, it is no longer open to acceptances and any accepting Just Eat
Shareholders cease to be bound by their acceptances.

Bob van Dijk, CEO of Prosus, commented: ""We would like to thank the Just Eat board and management
team for their constructive engagement throughout the process. As stated in our Original Offer and
subsequently, we consider Just Eat an attractive business though one which will require significant
investment. We have been clear throughout that we would remain disciplined in how we allocate our capital
and the price that we would offer.

We have an outstanding track record of executing M&A at the right price for our shareholders and of
generating strong returns. Just Eat is not an acquisition we wanted to make at any cost and while we have
significant financial capacity, we believe that our final offer of 800 pence per share was appropriate in light of
the investment required and preserved our ability to create value for our shareholders.

Our core operating segments are growing fast with significant runway ahead of them. We will continue to
identify and pursue opportunities that will be both additive to our current strategy and generate high levels of
return for our shareholders.""

In respect of Just Eat Shares held in certificated form, the Form of Acceptance, Second Form of Acceptance
and/or Third Form of Acceptance (as applicable), share certificate(s) and/or other document(s) of title will be
returned by post (or by such other method as may be approved by the Panel) within 14 days of the Final
Increased Offer lapsing to the person or agent whose name and address outside the Restricted Jurisdictions
is set out in the relevant box on the relevant Form of Acceptance or, if none is set out, to the first-named or
sole holder of his registered address outside the Restricted Jurisdictions. No such documents will be sent to
an address in any Restricted Jurisdiction.

In respect of Just Eat Shares held in uncertificated form, Computershare, the Receiving Agent, will,
immediately (or within such longer period as the Panel may permit, not exceeding 14 days after the lapsing
of the Final Increased Offer), give instructions to Euroclear to transfer all Just Eat Shares held in escrow
balances and in relation to which it is the escrow agent for the purposes of the Final Increased Offer to the
original available balances of the Just Eat Shareholders concerned.

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set out in the
Final Increased Offer Document (including words or expressions defined in the Final Increased Offer
Document by reference to the Offer Document).

THROUGH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY MIH FOOD DELIVERY HOLDINGS B.V
                                

PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL INCREASED OFFER DOCUMENT


Further to the announcement by Prosus N.V. (Prosus) on 19 December 2019 relating to the final
increased offer by its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) to
acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Final
Increased Offer), Prosus announces that the offer document containing full terms and conditions of
the Final Increased Offer and the procedures for its acceptance (the Final Increased Offer
Document) is being published and posted to the shareholders of Just Eat today, together with, in the
case of Just Eat Shareholders holding Just Eat Shares in certificated form, the related Third Form of
Acceptance to accept the Final Increased Offer. The Final Increased Offer Document will also be
published on Prosus’s website at www.prosus.com/investors/justeat. The Final Increased Offer is
subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Final Increased Offer Document and the Third Form
of Acceptance. The Final Increased Offer is a revision to the Increased Offer and should be construed
accordingly.

Bob van Dijk, CEO of Prosus, commented: “We maintain our belief that in the UK and other European
markets, Just Eat will require significant investments in own-delivery and technology as competitive
dynamics and customer preferences continue to evolve. We have always stated that we would remain
disciplined with respect to price on acquiring Just Eat, balancing our desire to own an attractive
business with the need for significant investment in that business while maintaining acceptable
returns for Prosus shareholders.”

To accept the Final Increased Offer in respect of certificated Just Eat Shares, the Third Form of
Acceptance accompanying this Document should be completed, signed and returned to
Computershare at Corporate Actions Projects, Bristol, BS99 6AH or by hand to                                               
Computershare, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS13 8AE, as soon as possible but in
any event so as to be received by not later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 10 January 2020.

To accept the Final Increased Offer in respect of uncertificated Just Eat Shares, acceptance
should be made electronically through CREST by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 10
January 2020. If you are a CREST sponsored member, you should refer to your CREST
sponsor as only your CREST sponsor will be able to send the necessary TTE Instruction to
Euroclear.

Just Eat Shareholders who have previously accepted the Original Offer or the Increased Offer
will automatically be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Final Increased Offer by virtue
of their prior acceptance and, therefore, such Just Eat Shareholders need not take any further
action.

If you have any questions relating to this announcement or the Final Increased Offer Document,
please contact the Receiving Agent, Computershare on 0370 707 1066, (if calling within the UK) or on

The Final Increased Offer will be being implemented solely pursuant to the terms of the Final
Increased Offer Document, which will contain further information about the Final Increased Offer.

This announcement does not constitute a prospectus or prospectus exempted document.

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Final
Increased Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England
and Wales and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons
into whose possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other
than the United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any
applicable requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United
Kingdom or the Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the
Final Increased Offer or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Final Increased Offer, may be                                                  
affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who
are in any doubt regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser
in their relevant jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute
a violation of the laws and/or regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the companies and other persons involved in the Final Increased Offer disclaim any
responsibility or liability for any violation of such restrictions by any person.

This announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City
Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the
information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this
announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and
Wales and/or the Netherlands.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Final Increased Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable
transaction under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just
Eat Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Final Increased Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law
and regulation, the Final Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or
indirectly in, into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile,
e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of
any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to
do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of
the Final Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted
Jurisdiction or where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Final Increased Offer
will not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or
within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the
laws of that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to
the Final Increased Offer are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or
otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other
jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such
documents (including agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward,
distribute or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to
do so would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the Final Increased Offer is implemented by way of
a Scheme (unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in
favour of the Scheme by any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Final Increased Offer will
not be capable of acceptance from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do
so would constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or
citizens of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11
November 2019.

Notice to US investors

The Final Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in
reliance on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
US Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Final Increased Offer is being made in the
United States by MIH and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of
their respective affiliates will be making the Final Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Final Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to
disclosure and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States                                                   
disclosure and procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable,
settlement procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Final Increased Offer will
comply with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement
procedures, particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Final Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Final Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on
which the Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or
arrangements to purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in
the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply
with applicable law, including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about
such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a
Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent
with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019
and the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Final Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and
under applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Final Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United
States federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of
the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US
securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is
substantial doubt as to the enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for
enforcement of judgments of US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws
and judgments of a US court.

                                                  
Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Final Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Final
Increased Offer or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this announcement. Any representation
to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United
States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the
tender offer requirements under the US Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as
the case may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Final Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in
nature and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations,
valuations, targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore
subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ
materially from the future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking
statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement
may be forward looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words
such as “targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”,
“outlook”, ”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”,
“estimates”, “will look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”,
“forecasts”, “cost-saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance
or the negative thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain
actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur
or be achieved. Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties
surrounding future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-
looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.
Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH
respectively and no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been
correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking
statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or                                                   
regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation,
and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from
operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group
(as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just
Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely
in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a
securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of
any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant
securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must
contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and
rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed
under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no
later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If
two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are
required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

UPDATE ON FINAL INCREASED CASH OFFER FOR JUST EAT PLC BY PROSUS N.V.
THROUGH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY MIH FOOD DELIVERY HOLDINGS B.V

                          

Prosus notes the announcement by Just Eat’s board regarding its recommendation and
Takeaway.com’s announcement regarding the acceptance level for its offer.

Prosus has offered to acquire the entire share capital of Just Eat for 800p per share. This cash offer
remains open to acceptances from Just Eat shareholders. However, Prosus does not plan currently to
make market purchases of Just Eat shares in support of its offer.

Commenting, Bob van Dijk, CEO of Prosus, said: “We maintain our belief that in the UK and other
European markets, Just Eat will require significant investments in own-delivery and technology as
competitive dynamics and customer preferences continue to evolve. We have always stated that we
would remain disciplined with respect to price on acquiring Just Eat, balancing our desire to own an
attractive business with the need for significant investment in that business while maintaining
acceptable returns for Prosus shareholders.”

This announcement is provided for information purposes only. It is not intended to and does not

otherwise acquire, subscribe for, exchange, sell or otherwise dispose of or exercise rights in respect of
any securities, or the solicitation of any vote or approval of an offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction,

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Final
Increased Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England
and Wales and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into
whose possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable
requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom or the
Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the Final Increased
Offer or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Final Increased Offer, may be affected by the laws
of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any doubt
regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their relevant
jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a violation of the
laws and/or regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the
companies and other persons involved in the Final Increased Offer disclaim any responsibility or liability
for any violation of such restrictions by any person.

This announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City
Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the
information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this
announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and
Wales and/or the Netherlands.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Final Increased Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable
transaction under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just
Eat Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Final Increased Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law and
regulation, the Final Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or
indirectly in, into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile,
e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of
any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to
do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of
the Final Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted
Jurisdiction or where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Final Increased Offer
will not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within
a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of
that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the Final
Increased Offer are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise
forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where
to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including
agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send them                                                    
in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so would violate the
laws in that jurisdiction. If the Final Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme (unless
otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour of the Scheme by
any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Final Increased Offer will not be capable of acceptance
from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation
of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or citizens
of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11 November
2019.

Notice to US investors

The Final Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in
reliance on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
US Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Final Increased Offer is being made in the
United States by MIH and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their
respective affiliates will be making the Final Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Final Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to
disclosure and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure
and procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Final Increased Offer will
comply with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement
procedures, particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make certain
purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Final Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Final Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which
the Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements
to purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market
at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be
disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with
Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will be
disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019 and
the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.


                                                     
The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under
applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Final Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United States
and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of the Netherlands
and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are residents of countries
other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just Eat, or any of their
respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. It may
be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors, officers and affiliates to
subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is substantial doubt as to the
enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for enforcement of judgments of
US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws and judgments of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Final Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Final Increased
Offer or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this announcement. Any representation to the
contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United States
or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the tender
offer requirements under the US Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the case
may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Final Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in
nature and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations,
valuations, targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject
to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially
from the future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements.
All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as “targets”,
“plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”, ”risk”, “seeks”,
“aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will look to”,
“budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-saving”, “is
subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative thereof, as well
as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “may”,
“could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements
are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-looking
statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on                                                     
such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Any forward-
looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as of the date of
this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH respectively and
no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just Eat.
All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus, MIH
or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and any
person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty, assurance or
guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking statements in
this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or regulatory obligations
(including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency
Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation, and each of the
foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this announcement
should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from operations, free
cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group (as applicable)
for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic published cash
flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just Eat, Prosus, MIH
or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant
securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an
offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must
make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period and, if later,
following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies
must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities
exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a
Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in
1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange
offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree
company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing
concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant
securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent                                                     
that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to
whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day
following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement
or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of
an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the
purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are required
to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

   800 PENCE PER JUST EAT SHARE. ELIGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED
                                    STATES
INTERESTED IN SELLING JUST EAT SHARES SHOULD CONTACT J.P. MORGAN CAZENOVE /
             MORGAN STANLEY (USING THE CONTACT DETAILS BELOW)

1.      Final Increased Cash Offer

Prosus N.V. (Prosus) is pleased to announce the terms of an increased and final cash offer by its
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) for the entire issued and to be
issued share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Final Increased Offer).

Under the terms of the Final Increased Offer, Just Eat Shareholders will be entitled to receive:

                             800 pence in cash for each Just Eat Share

The terms of the Final Increased Offer value the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital
of Just Eat at approximately £5.5 billion and represent a premium of approximately:

•       36 per cent. to the Closing Price of 589 pence per Just Eat Share on 21 October 2019 (being
        the last Business Day before the date of the Offer Announcement);

•       35 per cent. to the value of the Takeaway.com Offer of 594 pence per Just Eat Share based
        on Takeaway.com’s Closing Price of €71.00 on 21 October 2019 (being the last Business Day
        before the date of the Offer Announcement); and

•       26 per cent. to the Closing Price of 636 pence per Just Eat Share on 26 July (being the last
        Business Day before the commencement of the Offer Period).

The financial terms of the Final Increased Offer are final and will not be increased. The closing date of
the Final Increased Offer has been extended to 1.00 p.m. on 10 January 2020 and will not be extended
beyond that time (save with Panel consent).

Save as set out in this announcement, the Final Increased Offer is subject to the same terms and
conditions as the Increased Offer. The Final Increased Offer is a revision to the Increased Offer and
should be construed accordingly.

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Final Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in
any event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) 10 January 2020.

Commenting on the Final Increased Offer, Bob van Dijk, the Group CEO of Prosus said:

“We have been very clear from the beginning about our ambition to build the world’s leading Food
Delivery business. The acquisition of Just Eat, which brings its portfolio of good market positions, would
be a meaningful step in realising this goal. Following extensive discussions with Just Eat’s and Prosus’s
shareholders, we have decided to make a final increase in our cash offer to 800p per share. This level
delivers outstanding and certain value to Just Eat shareholders while also providing an appropriate
return for our own shareholders, given strong levels of competition and significant investment required
to reinvigorate growth. We urge Just Eat shareholders to accept this final offer and bring the uncertainty
around Just Eat’s future to a close.”

2.      MIH seeking to acquire Just Eat Shares

MIH is seeking to make market purchases of Just Eat Shares at a price of up to 800 pence per share.

Eligible Just Eat Shareholders, who are institutional investors outside the United States, interested in
selling their shares at the price of up to 800 pence per Just Eat Share should contact J.P. Morgan
Cazenove / Morgan Stanley (using their normal sales and trading contacts), who have authority from
Prosus and MIH to purchase Just Eat Shares other than pursuant to the Offer such as in the open
market or through privately negotiated purchases. Such purchases shall comply with the City Code, the
rules of the London Stock Exchange and Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act. Information about
such purchases will be disclosed as and if required by applicable securities laws. Retail investors should
contact their broker.

Due to regulatory requirements, MIH is unable to purchase Just Eat Shares from shareholders
incorporated or located in the United States, or where the Just Eat Shares would be sold from the United
States.

3.      Overview of the Final Increased Offer

Following further investor engagement, and in the context of strong equity market performance and
consolidation in the sector since Prosus’s Increased Offer, Prosus is today pleased to announce a Final
Increased Offer of 800 pence in cash per Just Eat Share.

The Final Increased Offer represents a compelling proposition for Just Eat Shareholders with the
certainty of a cash exit at a substantial premium to Just Eat’s unaffected share price and to the value
of the Takeaway.com Offer.

The Final Increased Offer represents a premium of 36 per cent to Just Eat’s Closing Price on 21 October
2019 (the last Business Day before the date of the Prosus Offer Announcement), which already includes
a premium from the Takeaway.com’s Offer and which Prosus believes compares favourably with
precedent premia for such transactions in a UK context.

While Prosus believes Just Eat is an attractive business with strong long-term potential, its historically
strong market positions are being eroded by intensifying competition. Prosus is the right owner for Just
Eat and intends to provide the necessary investment in product, technology, marketing and own-
delivery capabilities to enable Just Eat to shift to an own-delivery focused hybrid model, protect its
market positions, and capitalise on its long-term opportunity. Prosus benefits from a long and successful
track record of investing in and building out market-leading hybrid and own-delivery businesses.

The Offer is an important step towards achieving Prosus’s ambition to build the world’s leading Food
Delivery business and is the logical next step for Prosus’s and Just Eat’s partnership in iFood. Prosus
has the conviction and financial resources to help Just Eat achieve its long-term potential, whilst also
targeting an appropriate risk adjusted return on invested capital for Prosus shareholders.

Prosus believes that the proposed combination with Takeaway.com will not address Just Eat’s issues
and carries significant risk for Just Eat Shareholders. In the context of slowing organic growth,
Takeaway.com’s share price is at an all-time high and trading on a revenue multiple 3 times higher than
Just Eat’s own unaffected multiple.

Takeaway.com has limited experience in competing against own-delivery players operating at scale.
Furthermore, Takeaway.com’s management lacks experience of operating own-delivery operations at
scale, and has repeatedly stated that it believes own-delivery to be an inferior business model that
cannot be profitable. Prosus believes Takeaway.com will not be able to support Just Eat in competing
effectively in many of Just Eat’s core markets including the UK where Uber Eats and Deliveroo have
been operating at scale for years with large and growing market share.

Prosus believes that it is the right owner for Just Eat and Prosus’s Final Increased Offer provides
compelling and certain value to Just Eat Shareholders at a further premium to Takeaway.com’s
all-share offer, which comes with significant risk.

Prosus urges Just Eat Shareholders to accept the Final Increased Offer as soon as possible
and, in any event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) 10 January 2020.

4.      Financing of the Final Increased Offer

The cash consideration payable by MIH pursuant to the Final Increased Offer will be financed: (a) by a
bridge loan agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV,
Citibank, N.A., London Branch, Citibank, N.A., Jersey Branch, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A.,
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.a., Filiale Frankfurt am Main as original
lenders, providing for a term loan bridge facility; and (b) from the existing cash resources of Prosus.

J.P. Morgan Cazenove, as financial adviser to Prosus and MIH, is satisfied that the resources available
to MIH are sufficient to enable it to satisfy in full the cash consideration payable to Just Eat Shareholders
under the terms of the Final Increased Offer.

5.      How to accept the Final Increased Offer

A revised offer document (the Final Increased Offer Document) containing the full terms of, and
conditions to, the Final Increased Offer together with the associated revised form of acceptance (the
Third Form of Acceptance) will be posted to Just Eat Shareholders and be available, subject to certain
restrictions relating to persons resident in Restricted Jurisdictions, on Prosus’s website at

Eat Shares should complete either: (a) the Second Form of Acceptance accompanying the

Just Eat Shares, should do so electronically through CREST by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London
time) on 10 January 2020. If you are a CREST sponsored member, you should refer to your
CREST sponsor as only your CREST sponsor will be able to send the necessary TTE Instruction
to Euroclear.

Just Eat Shareholders who have previously accepted the Offer or the Increased Offer will
automatically be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Final Increased Offer by virtue of
their prior acceptance and do not need take any further action.

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Final Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in

Just Eat Shareholders who have accepted the Takeaway.com Offer should be aware that if the
Takeaway.com Offer has not become or been declared unconditional as to acceptances by 1.00
p.m. on 1 January 2020, they can withdraw their acceptance of the Takeaway.com Offer and
accept the Final Increased Offer.

6.      Level of acceptances and disclosure of interests in relevant securities

As at 1.00 p.m. on 19 December 2019, MIH had received valid acceptances of the Increased Offer in
respect of 44,718 Just Eat Shares representing approximately 0.0065 per cent. of the current issued
share capital of Just Eat, all of which may count towards the Acceptance Condition. MIH does not own
any Just Eat Shares.

The percentages of Just Eat Shares referred to in this announcement are based on a figure of
682,985,706 Just Eat Shares in issue on 18 December 2019.

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Final
Increased Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England
and Wales and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into
whose possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable
requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom or the
Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the Final Increased
Offer or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Final Increased Offer, may be affected by the laws
of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any doubt
regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their relevant
jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a violation of the
laws and/or regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the

This announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law and
regulation, the Final Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or

do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of
the Final Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted
Jurisdiction or where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Final Increased Offer
will not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within

that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the Final

otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour of the Scheme by

of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or citizens
of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11 November
2019.

Notice to US investors

The Final Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in
reliance on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
US Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Final Increased Offer is being made in the
United States by MIH and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their
respective affiliates will be making the Final Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Final Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to
disclosure and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure
and procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Final Increased Offer will
comply with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement
procedures, particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make certain
purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Final Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Final Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which
the Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements
to purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market
at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be
disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will    be    available   on     the    London     Stock   Exchange      website    at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with
Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will be
disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will    be    available   on     the    London     Stock   Exchange      website    at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

In relation to MIH’s intention to buy Just Eat Shares in the market outside the Final Increased Offer,
MIH and its affiliates and brokers cannot purchase Just Eat Shares from Just Eat Shareholders
incorporated or located in the United States or where the Just Eat Shares would be sold from the United
States. Any purchases will be made to the extent permitted by, and in compliance with Rule 14e-5(b)
under the US Exchange Act and in compliance with the City Code.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019 and
the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under
applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Final Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United States
and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of the Netherlands
and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are residents of countries
other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just Eat, or any of their
respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. It may
be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors, officers and affiliates to
subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is substantial doubt as to the
enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for enforcement of judgments of
US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws and judgments of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Final Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Final Increased
Offer or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this announcement. Any representation to the
contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United States
or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the tender
offer requirements under the US Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the case
may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

nature and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations,
valuations, targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject
to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially
from the future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements.

as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “may”,
“could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements
are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many factors

statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Any forward-
looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as of the date of
this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH respectively and
no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just Eat.
All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus, MIH

guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking statements in
this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or regulatory obligations

Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation, and each of the
foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this announcement
should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from operations, free
cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group (as applicable)
for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic published cash
flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just Eat, Prosus, MIH
or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant
securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an
offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must
make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period and, if later,
following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies
must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities
exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a
Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in
1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange
offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree
company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing
concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant
securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent
that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to
whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day
following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement
or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of
an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the
purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are required
to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

    (b) All prices and Closing Prices for Takeaway.com Shares are closing middle market quotations
        derived from the Euronext Amsterdam Daily Official List.

    (c) The aggregate value of the Final Increased Offer consideration of approximately £5.5 billion is

        Eat’s fully diluted share capital (as referred to below).

    (d) The fully diluted share capital of Just Eat is 687,107,905 shares (as published by
        Takeaway.com in its circular to shareholders dated 9 December 2019).

    (e) The strong equity market performance since Prosus’s Increased Offer refers to the 4.2%
        increase in the FTSE 100 from market close on 6 December 2019 to the market close on 18
        December 2019 (the last practicable date prior to the publication of this announcement).

    (f) Takeaway.com’s slowing organic order growth is illustrated by an order growth of 21 per cent
        in Q3 2019 vs 22 per cent in H1 2019 in Germany and an order growth of 15 per cent in Q3
        2019 vs 18 per cent in H1 2019 in the Netherlands.

    (h) Takeaway.com broker consensus is based on the following:

        i.    Takeaway.com consensus comprises all analyst notes available to Prosus since 31 July

    enterprise value of €5,655 million is calculated as Takeaway.com’s equity value of €5,468
    million (based on total shares outstanding of 61.5 million as per Takeaway.com’s circular to
    shareholders published on 9 December 2019 and share price of €88.90 as at 18 December
    2019 plus net debt of €166 million, and other adjustments of €21 million. 2020 revenue

         J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley have been excluded as they are connected
         advisors to Prosus. Estimates from Bank of America Merrill Lynch have been excluded as
         they are a connected advisor to Takeaway.com;

   ii.   the minimum 2020 group revenue estimate per the consensus is £1,247 million, the
         maximum is £1,458 million, and the arithmetic average is £1,301 million; and

   iii. in accordance with Rule 28.8(c) of the City Code, the consensus estimates are not shown
        with the agreement or the approval of Just Eat.

(k) Just Eat’s enterprise value / 2020 revenue of 3.4x as at 26 July 2019 is based on:

         plus net debt of £118 million, and other adjustments of £(63) million; and

   ii.   2020 revenue reflects the arithmetic average broker consensus of £1,301 million as
         defined above.

(l) The statement that Takeaway.com is currently trading on a revenue multiple 3.0 times Just

11 December 2019

                              UPDATE ON INCREASED CASH OFFER

                                                  for

                                           JUST EAT PLC

                                                  by

                                            PROSUS N.V.

       through its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V.


Publication of Investor Presentation

Further to the announcement on 9 December 2019 by Prosus N.V. (Prosus) and MIH Food Delivery
Holdings B.V. (MIH) of their increased offer to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital
of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Increased Offer), Prosus and MIH are today pleased to announce the
publication of an investor presentation (the Investor Presentation) in connection with the Increased
Offer.

A copy of the presentation is available at www.prosus.com/investors/justeat.

Prosus continues to believe that its superior cash offer represents compelling and certain value to
Just Eat Shareholders. The Increased Offer is at a premium to the look through value of the
Takeaway.com Offer, and provides certainty of value for Just Eat Shareholders, in contrast to the
significant risks associated with the Takeaway.com Offer. The presentation develops the arguments
set out in the offer document, and in addition, contains the following new information:

Illustrative Premium Calculation

•       Prosus Increased Offer of 740 pence per share in cash comes at a 44 per cent. illustrative
        premium assuming the 15% premium on announcement of the Takeaway.com offer in July
        remained embedded in Just Eat’s share price of 589 pence as at 21 October 2019 (implying
        an illustrative unaffected price for Just Eat of 512 pence adjusted for this 15% premium)

                                                
The illustrative premium of 44% is calculated by reversing the 15% premium on announcement of the
Takeaway.com offer out of the 589p Takeaway.com share price on 21 October 2019 (that being the
last business day prior to the date of Prosus’s Original Offer Announcement), to establish an
illustrative unaffected Just Eat share price for that day of 512 pence, which, compared to Prosus’s
increased cash offer of 740 pence implies a 44% premium.

Illustrative Value of Just Eat at the Grubhub 2020 enterprise value / revenue multiple (updated
for the latest GrubHub share price as of 10 December 2019)

If Just Eat were to re-rate to GrubHub's current 2020 EV/Revenue multiple of 2.7x, this would result in
an illustrative share price for Just Eat of 502 pence, to which Prosus’s increased offer represents an
illustrative premium of 48%.

Prosus believes that the Increased Offer provides compelling and certain value for Just Eat’s
Shareholders at a significant premium to Takeaway.com’s all-share offer, which comes with
significant risks.

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in any
event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) 27 December 2019.

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set
out in the offer document dated 10 December 2019 in respect of the Increased Offer.

A    copy     of    this  announcement    will  be    available     on    Prosus’s   website   at
www.prosus.com/investors/justeat, subject to certain restrictions relating to persons resident in
Restricted Jurisdictions.

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United
States by MIH and no one else.

The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

                                                  
Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the
Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to
purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at
prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent
with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Original Offer Document and the Increased
Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards
applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to financial
information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and
under applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of
the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US
securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Increased Offer or
passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality                                                   
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United
States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the
tender offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the
case may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature
and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations,
targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks
and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the
future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All
statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as
“targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”,
”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will
look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-
saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative
thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or
results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding
future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-
looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.
Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH
respectively and no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been
correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking
statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or
regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation,
and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

                                                     
No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from
operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group
(as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just
Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely
in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a
securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of
any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant
securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must
contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and
rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed
under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no
later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If
two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are
required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

Sources and Bases of Calculations

Grubhub’s enterprise value / 2020 revenue of 2.7x as at 10 December 2019 is based on: Grubhub’s
enterprise value of US$4,007 million is calculated as Grubhub’s equity value of US$3,690 million
(based on diluted shares outstanding of 94.5 million and share price of US$39.04 as at 10 December
2019) plus net debt of US$317 million. 2020 revenue reflects the Capital IQ broker consensus of
US$1,461 million.

The illustrative value of Just Eat at the Grubhub 2020 enterprise value / revenue multiple is for
illustrative purposes only and should not be interpreted as a valuation estimate or profit forecast under
the City Code. It is calculated by applying Grubhub’s enterprise value / 2020 revenue multiple (as
calculated above) of 2.7x to Just Eat’s 2020 consensus revenue of £1,276 million (as detailed below)
to obtain an illustrative enterprise value of £3,501 million, and using net debt of £118 million, and
other adjustments of £(63) million to obtain an illustrative equity value of £3,446 million. Dividing by
shares outstanding of 687 million obtains the illustrative share price of 502 pence per share, to which
Prosus’s Increased Offer of 740 pence per share represents a 48% premium.

Just Eat consensus comprises all analyst notes available to Prosus since 31 July 2019 (the date of
Just Eat’s H1 2019 results statement) as at 10 December 2019 (the last practicable date prior to the
publication of this Announcement) and includes group level estimates from the following analysts:
Arete Research Services (4 November 2019), Barclays (22 October 2019), Berenberg (9 August
2019), Credit Suisse (13 November 2019), Exane BNP Paribas (30 October 2019), HSBC (23
October 2019), Investec (04 November 2019), Jefferies (22 October 2019), Liberum (23 October
2019), Macquarie (2 October 2019), Numis Securities (31 October 2019), Peel Hunt (30 October
2019) and RBC Capital Markets (24 October 2019). Estimates from Goldman Sachs and UBS have                                                 
been excluded from the consensus as they are connected advisors to Just Eat. Estimates from J.P.
Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley have been excluded as they are connected advisors to
Prosus. Estimates from Bank of America Merrill Lynch have been excluded as they are a connected
advisor to Takeaway.com.The minimum 2020 group revenue estimate per the consensus is £1,191
million, the maximum is £1,458 million, and the arithmetic average is £1,276 million. In accordance
with Rule 28.8(c) of the City Code, the consensus estimates are not shown with the agreement or the
approval of Just Eat.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

10 December 2019

                             UPDATE ON INCREASED CASH OFFER

                                                 for

                                           JUST EAT PLC

                                                  by

                                            PROSUS N.V.

       through its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V.


Update on Prosus’s Increased Offer to acquire Just Eat

Further to the announcement yesterday by Prosus N.V. (Prosus) and MIH Food Delivery Holdings
B.V. (MIH) of their increased offer to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Just
Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Increased Offer), Prosus and MIH are pleased to confirm that the Spanish
Markets and Competition Commission have cleared the acquisition of Just Eat Shares by MIH under
the Spanish Competition Act.

This is an important milestone that further increases deal certainty of the Increased Offer following
yesterday’s reduction of the Acceptance Condition to a simple majority of the Just Eat Shares (50 per
cent. plus one Just Eat Share). In contrast, the Takeaway.com Offer remains subject to a 75 per cent.
acceptance condition and the approval of Takeaway.com’s own shareholders, and there can be no
certainty that the higher acceptance condition and/or shareholder approval will be obtained. The
Increased Offer is therefore clearly superior to the Takeaway.com Offer both in terms of value offered
and deal certainty.

Commenting on the receipt of clearance, Bob van Dijk, the Group CEO of Prosus said:

“We are pleased to have cleared the competition hurdle which further underlines the certainty and
deliverability of our superior cash offer of 740p per share to Just Eat Shareholders.”

                                                
The Increased Offer remains subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the remaining Conditions set out
in the increased offer document dated 10 December 2019 in respect of the Increased Offer (the
Increased Offer Document).

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set
out in the Increased Offer Document.

A    copy     of    this  announcement    will  be    available    on     Prosus’s   website   at

This announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City

consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to him.

                                                 
Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law

the Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction

constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United
States by MIH and no one else.

The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the
Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to
purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at
prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and    will    be    available   on    the    London    Stock    Exchange     website    at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent
with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.

                                                   
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service    and      will  be      available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Original Offer Document and the Increased
Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards
applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to financial
information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and
under applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of
the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US
securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Increased Offer or
passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United
States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the
tender offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the
case may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature
and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations,
targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks
and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the
future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All
statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as
“targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”,
”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will                                                   
look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-
saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative
thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or
results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding
future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-
looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.
Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH
respectively and no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been
correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking
statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or
regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation,
and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from
operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group
(as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just
Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely
in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

                                                 
An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a
securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of
any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant
securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must
contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and
rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed
under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no
later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If
two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are
required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

                    PUBLICATION OF THE INCREASED OFFER DOCUMENT


Further to the announcement by Prosus N.V. (Prosus) on 9 December 2019 relating to the increased
offer by its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) to acquire the
entire issued and to be issued share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Increased Offer), Prosus
announces that the offer document containing full terms and conditions of the Increased Offer and the
procedures for its acceptance (the Increased Offer Document) is being published and posted to the
shareholders of Just Eat today, together with, in the case of Just Eat Shareholders holding Just Eat
Shares in certificated form, the related Second Form of Acceptance to accept the Increased Offer.
The Increased Offer Document will also be published on Prosus’s website at
www.prosus.com/investors/justeat. The Increased Offer is subject to the terms and conditions set out
in the Increased Offer Document and the Second Form of Acceptance. The Increased Offer is a
revision to the Offer and should be construed accordingly.

The level of acceptances required to satisfy the Acceptance Condition of the Increased Offer has
been reduced to a simple majority (50 per cent. plus one Just Eat Share) of the Just Eat Shares.

To accept the Increased Offer in respect of certificated Just Eat Shares, the Second Form of
Acceptance accompanying this Document should be completed, signed and returned to
Computershare at Corporate Actions Projects, Bristol, BS99 6AH or by hand to

                                               
Computershare, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS13 8AE, as soon as possible but in
any event so as to be received by not later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 27 December 2019.

To accept the Increased Offer in respect of uncertificated Just Eat Shares, acceptance should
be made electronically through CREST by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 27
December 2019. If you are a CREST sponsored member, you should refer to your CREST
sponsor as only your CREST sponsor will be able to send the necessary TTE Instruction to
Euroclear.

Just Eat Shareholders who have previously accepted the Original Offer will automatically be
deemed to have accepted the terms of the Increased Offer by virtue of their prior acceptance
and, therefore, such Just Eat Shareholders need not take any further action.

If you have any questions relating to this announcement or the Offer Document, please contact the
Receiving Agent, Computershare on 0370 707 1066, (if calling within the UK) or on +44 370 707 1066

time).

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in any
event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 27 December 2019.

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set
out in the Increased Offer Document in respect of the Offer (including words or expressions defined in
the Increased Offer Document by reference to the Offer Document).

The Increased Offer Document also includes corrected share of orders from Low Competition Markets
for Takeaway.com for H1 2019 (69% as compared to 65% stated previously) and for a combination of
Takeaway.com and Just Eat for H1 2019 (27% as compared to 28% stated previously). These
corrected percentages highlight an even stronger decrease in the share of Low Competition Markets
for the combined entity.

Further information

This Announcement is provided for information purposes only. It is not intended to and does not

otherwise acquire, subscribe for, exchange, sell or otherwise dispose of or exercise rights in respect
of any securities, or the solicitation of any vote or approval of an offer to buy securities in any

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Increased
Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England and
Wales and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into
whose possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other
than the United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any
                                                 
applicable requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United
Kingdom or the Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the
Increased Offer or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Increased Offer, may be affected by the
laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any
doubt regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their
relevant jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a
violation of the laws and/or regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the companies and other persons involved in the Increased Offer disclaim any
responsibility or liability for any violation of such restrictions by any person.

This Announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City
Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the
information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this
announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and
Wales and/or the Netherlands.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Increased Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable
transaction under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just
Eat Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law
and regulation, the Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or
indirectly in, into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile,
e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of
any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to
do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of
the Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction
or where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Increased Offer will not be
capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within a
Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of
that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the
Increased Offer are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise
forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction
where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents
(including agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute
or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so
would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme
(unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour of the
Scheme by any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Increased Offer will not be capable of
acceptance from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would
constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or
citizens of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11
November 2019.

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United
States by MIH and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their
respective affiliates will be making the Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

                                                  
The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the
Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to
purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at
prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent
with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019
and the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and
under applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of
the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US
securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has

States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the

Forward looking statements

This Announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature
and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations,
targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks
and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the
future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All
statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as
“targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”,
”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will
look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-
saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative
thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or
results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding
future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-
looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.
Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH
respectively and no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been
correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking
statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or
                                                    
regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation,
and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from
operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group
(as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just
Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely
in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a
securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of
any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant
securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must
contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and
rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed
under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no
later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If
two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are
required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

9 December 2019


STATEMENT REGARDING TAKEAWAY.COM N.V. (“TAKEAWAY.COM”) INVESTOR CIRCULAR

The boards of Prosus N.V. (“Prosus”) and MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (“MIH”) note the release
this morning of an investor circular by Takeaway.com.

The investor circular includes the implausible claim that Just Eat’s shares could have an illustrative
trading value of up to around £11 under the Takeaway.com Offer. This is based on the unsubstantiated
claim that the combined business of Just Eat and Takeaway.com (the “Combined Group”) could re-rate
to Takeaway.com’s average trading revenue multiple since IPO of 8.3x.

Prosus believes that the combination could be highly value destructive. Given that Just Eat’s revenues
would account for 73% of the Combined Group’s business, and a significantly reduced proportion of
Combined Group’s business would operate in Low Competition Markets, Prosus believes that Just Eat’s
trading multiple would be much more relevant to the trading level of the Combined Group than
Takeaway.com’s above market multiple. If the Combined Group were to re-rate to Just Eat’s trading
revenue multiple prior to Prosus’s approach of 3.3x, the illustrative trading value of Just Eat’s shares
would be around £4 per share(1). Based on this calculation, the illustrative value of Takeaway.com’s
shares would be €47 per share(1). Prosus believes that this would be consistent with trends in other
comparable food delivery businesses. It would also represent a premium to GrubHub’s trading revenue
multiple of 2.9x.

Relative to these two potential outcomes, which in themselves illustrate the significant uncertainties for
shareholders presented by the Takeaway.com Offer, Prosus’s Increased Offer of £7.40 provides
compelling value and certainty to Just Eat’s shareholders.

Furthermore, Prosus believes that it is illogical for Takeaway.com to refer to Prosus’s Increased Offer
as “derisory”, when its own, inherently more risky offer, comes at a significant discount to Prosus’s
Increased Offer.

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set out
in Prosus’s offer document dated 11 November 2019 in respect of the Offer.

This Announcement is provided for information purposes only. It is not intended to and does not

otherwise acquire, subscribe for, exchange, sell or otherwise dispose of or exercise rights in respect of

This Announcement does not constitute a prospectus or prospectus exempted document.

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Increased
Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England and Wales
and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into whose
possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable
requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom or the
Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the Increased Offer
or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Increased Offer, may be affected by the laws of the
relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any doubt regarding
such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their relevant jurisdiction
without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a violation of the laws and/or
regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and
other persons involved in the Increased Offer disclaim any responsibility or liability for any violation of
such restrictions by any person.

This Announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City
Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the
information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this
announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and
Wales and/or the Netherlands.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Increased Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable
transaction under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just
Eat Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law and
regulation, the Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or indirectly in,
into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile, e-mail or other
electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of any facility of a
national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to do so would
violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of the Increased
Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to do
so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Increased Offer will not be capable of acceptance
by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any
other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction. Accordingly,
copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the Increased Offer are not being, and
must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into
or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws of that
jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including agents, custodians, nominees and
trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send them in or into or from any Restricted
Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the
Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme (unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and
regulation), no person may vote in favour of the Scheme by any use, means, instrumentality or form
and the Increased Offer will not be capable of acceptance from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any
other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or citizens
of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11 November
2019.

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United States by MIH
and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their respective affiliates
will be making the Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make certain
purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the Increased
Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for acceptance (or, if the
Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the Scheme becomes
effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to purchase were to be
made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at prevailing prices or in
private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law, including, to the extent
applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required
in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be
available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in
accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc and their affiliates may continue to
act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain
other purchasing activities consistent with their respective normal and usual practice and applicable
law. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK and the United
States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock
Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made
public in the United Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019 and
the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to                                                    
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under
applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United States
and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of the Netherlands
and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are residents of countries
other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just Eat, or any of their
respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. It may
be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors, officers and affiliates to
subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is substantial doubt as to the
enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for enforcement of judgments of
US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws and judgments of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Increased Offer or
passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United States
or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the tender
offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the case
may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This Announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and
are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations, targets,
estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and
uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the future
results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All statements
other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward looking
statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as “targets”,
“plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”, ”risk”, “seeks”,
“aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will look to”,
“budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-saving”, “is
subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative thereof, as well
as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “may”,
“could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements
are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments                                                     
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-looking
statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Any forward-
looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as of the date of
this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH respectively and
no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just Eat.
All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant
securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an
offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must
make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period and, if later,
following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies
must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities
exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a
Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in
1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange
offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree                                                    
company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing
concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant
securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent
that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to
whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day
following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement
or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of
an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the
purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at

Sources and Bases

   (a) The reference to the Just Eat share of value created by Combined Group re-rating to 3.3x being
       worth 412p per share is calculated as follows:

      i.   Combined Group expected revenue for the year ended 31 December 2020 of £1,740m
           calculated as:

               a. Takeaway.com’s expected revenue for the year ended 31 December 2020 of
                  £467m sourced from the Takeaway.com Investor Circular dated 9 December

     ii.   Combined Group enterprise value (pre-NPV of net cost benefits) £5,693m is calculated
           as Combined Group expected revenue for the year ended 31 December 2020 of £1,740m
           multiplied by a 3.3x multiple based on Just Eat’s enterprise value / 2020 revenue as at 21
           October 2019 (being the last Business Day prior to the date of the Offer Announcement).

    iii.   Combined Group net debt of £267m sourced from the Takeaway.com Investor Circular
           dated 9 December 2019.

    iv.    Combined Group equity value (pre-NPV of net cost benefits) of £5,426m is calculated as
           Combined Group enterprise value (pre-NPV of net cost benefits) of £5,693m less
           Combined Group net debt of £267m.

     v.    Just Eat Shareholders’ share in the Combined Group equity value (pre-NPV of net cost
           benefits) of £2,828m is calculated as Just Eat Shareholders’ share of the Combined
           Group of 52.12% sourced and based in paragraph 19.2(C)(i) multiplied by the Combined
           Group equity value (pre-NPV of net cost benefits) of £5,426m.

    vi.    Just Eat Shareholders’ share in the Combined Group equity value (pre-NPV of net cost
           benefits) of £2,828m divided by the fully diluted share capital of Just Eat of 687,107,905
           shares outstanding is equal to 412p.

   (b) Grubhub's enterprise value / 2020 revenue is based on:

    vii.   Grubhub’s enterprise value of US$4,199 million is calculated as Grubhub's equity value of
           US$3,882 million (based on diluted shares outstanding of 94.7 million and share price of
           US$41.01 as at 6 December 2019) plus net debt of US$317 million.

   viii.   2020 revenue reflects the Capital IQ broker consensus of US$1,461 million.

   (c) The reference to Just Eat’s revenues accounting for 73% of the total is based on:

       per cent. market share (based on Google Trends).

                                                
   (e) The value of the Takeaway.com Offer as at 6 December 2019 of 710 pence per Just Eat Share

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

9 December 2019


Increased cash offer for JUST EAT PLC by MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. a 
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Prosus N.V.
                                                  
                                       

1.      Increased Cash Offer

On 22 October 2019, Prosus N.V. (Prosus) announced the terms of a cash offer by its wholly-owned
indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH), to acquire the entire issued and to be
issued share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Offer Announcement). On 11 November 2019,
the Offer Document setting out the full terms and conditions of the Offer was published.

Today, Prosus is pleased to announce the terms of an increased cash offer for the entire issued and
to be issued share capital of Just Eat by MIH (the Increased Offer).

Under the terms of the Increased Offer, Just Eat Shareholders will be entitled to receive:

                             740 pence in cash for each Just Eat Share

The terms of the Increased Offer value the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of
Just Eat at approximately £5.1 billion and represent a premium of approximately:

•       25.6 per cent. to the Closing Price of 589 pence per Just Eat Share on 21 October 2019
        (being the last Business Day before the date of the Offer Announcement); and

•       24.6 per cent. to the value of the Takeaway.com Offer of 594 pence per Just Eat Share based
        on Takeaway.com’s Closing Price of €71.00 on 21 October 2019 (being the last Business Day
        before the date of the Offer Announcement);


                                               
MIH also announces today that it has reduced the level of acceptances required to satisfy the
Acceptance Condition to a simple majority (50 per cent. plus one Just Eat Share) of Just Eat Shares,
thereby significantly increasing deal certainty.

As a consequence of today’s announcement, the closing date of the Increased Offer has been
extended to 1.00 p.m. on 27 December 2019.

Save as set out in this announcement, the Increased Offer is subject to the same terms and
conditions as the Offer. The Increased Offer is a revision to the Offer and should be construed
accordingly.

Commenting on the Increased Offer, Bob van Dijk, the Group CEO of Prosus said:

“Following the announcement of our offer, we have had the opportunity to listen to the views of Just
Eat Shareholders, share our perspective on the global food delivery sector and reflect on the
unquestionable challenges Just Eat faces, as clearly seen in its Q3 results. We have also had
extensive discussions with our own shareholders with regards to our long term strategy for food
delivery and Just Eat’s role within that. We continue to believe in the sector and, as we have
demonstrated in Brazil, if you act decisively and invest effectively in technology as well as the
opportunities of own-delivery, then you can build an attractive growth business that is equipped to win
in the long-term. We believe the investment required is substantial and this impacts our view of
potential returns. As disciplined investors we obviously need to factor the required investment into our
value considerations.

Just Eat is a quality business, which we believe has all the ingredients to be transformed into a long-
term sector winner. In recognition of this potential, we have decided to increase our offer to 740 pence
per share, which we believe provides Just Eat Shareholders with compelling value and therefore good
reason to accept our all-cash offer. Unlike the Takeaway.com Offer, which relies on shares remaining
at an above sector multiple, our cash offer provides certainty of value to Just Eat Shareholders. We
urge shareholders to accept our offer, as it is the only one that delivers certainty in the face of
undeniable industry change.”

2.      Overview of the Increased Offer

Following Prosus’s offer for Just Eat, Prosus’s management have had extensive discussions with Just
Eat Shareholders to explain the rationale for the Offer and the compelling value it represents.
Prosus’s management have also had extensive discussions with Prosus’s own shareholders,
including at Prosus’s recent Capital Markets Day with regards to Prosus’s long-term strategy for food
delivery and Just Eat’s role in this strategy.

Prosus continues to believe that Just Eat is an attractive business, albeit one that requires investment
which has now also been acknowledged by the Just Eat Board, which Prosus has taken into account
when assessing the targeted return on investment for its shareholders and the price it can justify
offering for Just Eat.

Following careful consideration, and in the interest of bringing the process to a close, Prosus has
decided to increase its offer to 740 pence per Just Eat Share in cash, whilst also reducing its
acceptance condition to a simple majority (50 per cent. plus one Just Eat Share). Prosus believes the
Increased Offer underscores its commitment to the transaction and constitutes attractive and certain
value for Just Eat Shareholders, while allowing Prosus to target appropriate risk-adjusted returns for
its own shareholders.

The Increased Offer is at a 25.6 per cent premium to Just Eat’s closing share price on 21 October
2019 (the last Business Day before the date of the Prosus Offer Announcement), which Prosus                                                
believes compares favourably with precedent premia for such transactions in a UK context when
taking into account that the Just Eat share price on the day before the Offer Announcement (21
October 2019) of 589 pence already included a premium from the Takeaway.com Offer. The
Increased Offer also represents a 10.4 per cent. premium to the initial offer of 670p made to the Just
Eat Board by Prosus. Further, the value of the Increased Offer comes at a premium to the value of the
Takeaway.com Offer when it was announced of 731 pence, which was recommended by the Just Eat
Board. Prosus encourages the Just Eat Board to recognise the superior value of Prosus’s Increased
Offer.

The Increased Offer is superior to the look through value of the Takeaway.com Offer and provides
certainty of value for Just Eat Shareholders, in contrast to the significant risks associated with
swapping into the shares of a company currently trading on a revenue multiple 3 times higher than
Just Eat’s own unaffected multiple.

2.1       Prosus’s Increased Offer provides compelling and certain value for a business that is
          facing substantial challenges

While Prosus believes Just Eat is an attractive business with strong long-term potential, it is currently
facing significant challenges. Just Eat’s historically strong market positions are being eroded by
intensifying competition in the UK and other core markets, including Spain and Italy, with market
share loss recently accelerating in a number of markets. Just Eat has seen UK year-on-year order
growth deteriorate substantially from 30.9 per cent. in 2016 to 8 per cent. in Q3 2019 and UK EBITDA
margin decrease from 51.4 per cent. in 2016 to 35.2 per cent. in H1 2019. Just Eat has lost its leading
position in five of its thirteen markets. Unsurprisingly, shareholder returns have similarly suffered -
over the last two years Just Eat has delivered a negative shareholder return of -15.6 per cent. (versus
+4.3 per cent. for FTSE 350).

While the Just Eat price on the day before the date of the Prosus Offer Announcement (21 October
2019) was 589 pence, in Prosus’s view there is significant further downside risk to this share price.
The Just Eat Board has now acknowledged that increased investment is required and that this “may
impact” profitability. This statement was made after Prosus’s Offer Announcement and is not reflected
in the current Just Eat share price, which Prosus believes has decoupled from fundamentals and is
currently trading on M&A speculation. In a comparable context, Grubhub has seen significant
derating, and is now trading at 2.9x 2020 revenues – if Just Eat were trading at this multiple, the
illustrative share price would be 526 pence to which Prosus’s Increased Offer represents an
illustrative 40.7 per cent. premium (calculated by multiplying Just Eat’s consensus 2020 revenue by
2.9x and applying Just Eat’s enterprise value to equity bridge of -£31 million to get an illustrative
equity value of £3,614 million, then dividing by Just Eat’s fully diluted shares of 687 million to get an
illustrative share price of 526 pence per share).(1)

Prosus believes Takeaway.com’s claims about the lack of comparability between Just Eat’s and
Grubhub’s situations are flawed and fail to appreciate the competitive dynamics the two companies
are facing. Both companies are marketplace incumbents with a history of market leadership and
strong profitability. Both have been disrupted by intensifying competition from well-funded and rapidly
growing entrants operating an own-delivery led model. Despite attempts to defend their position by
rolling out own-delivery operations both companies have continued to lose market share and
experience slowing growth and decreased profitability.

(1)     This calculation is illustrative and should not be interpreted as a valuation estimate or profit forecast under
      the Takeover Code
                                                       
2.2       Prosus’s Increased Offer takes into account significant investments required in own-
          delivery, product, technology and marketing

Prosus believes Just Eat has underinvested in addressing the challenges outlined above, with only
£51 million invested in growth initiatives in 2018, substantially less than peers including iFood,
Grubhub and Delivery Hero. Prosus believes that this underinvestment has prevented Just Eat from
effectively transitioning to a hybrid model.

In Prosus’s view the 25 per cent. share of own-delivery orders that the Just Eat Board quotes masks
Just Eat’s lack of traction with its own-delivery rollout as it represents a blend of Canada (acquired by
Just Eat in December 2016) with 100 per cent. own-delivery and other geographies where own-
delivery represented only 7.8 per cent. of orders in H1 2019. Notably, within Just Eat’s portfolio,
Canada (100 per cent. own-delivery), and Brazil (greater than 20 per cent. own-delivery) exhibit vastly
superior growth compared to other assets such as UK, Spain and Italy where Just Eat is losing
market share at an accelerating pace to own-delivery competitors with a superior customer
proposition.

Just Eat’s track record in Australia and New Zealand starkly demonstrates how underinvestment can
erode value. Just Eat acquired Menulog in May 2015 for £421 million. Prosus believes Menulog was
slow to react to the intensifying competitive pressure after Deliveroo and Uber Eats entered the
market, investing less than £10 million in 2018 to enhance its proposition. As a result, Menulog lost
market leadership and market share and suffered declining revenue. In 2017 Just Eat incurred a £180
million impairment relating to Menulog, and current broker consensus for Menulog’s SOTP value is
£104 million, 75 per cent. below the acquisition price.

This is in contrast to Brazil, where, with Prosus’s operating support and investment (in 2018, Prosus
announced an additional investment commitment of US$400 million in iFood) in partnership with Just
Eat, iFood has been able to swiftly react to competitive pressures, rapidly building out its own-delivery
capabilities and accelerating its growth.

As consistently stated by Prosus, and now acknowledged by Just Eat’s Board, Just Eat requires
increased investment, which Prosus intends to make in own-delivery, marketing, product and
technology. This investment need is taken into account in the value of the Increased Offer.

2.3       Prosus’s Increased Offer provides certainty whilst the Takeaway.com Offer carries
          significant risks for Just Eat Shareholders

The Takeaway.com Offer carries significant risk for Just Eat Shareholders with Takeaway.com’s
current share price of €86.50 marginally below its all-time high. Takeaway.com is trading at 9.9x
2020E enterprise value/revenue, two to three times the level of peers. This is in the context of
Takeaway.com’s Q3 2019 order growth slowing to 15 per cent. for the Netherlands and 21 per cent.
for Germany (by comparison, Prosus’s food assets are growing at 320 per cent. for Swiggy, 122 per
cent. for iFood and 92 per cent. for Delivery Hero). At these valuation levels, Prosus believes that
there is little room for execution missteps, further growth slowdown or increased competition.

Immediately prior to acquiring Delivery Hero’s German assets in 2018, Takeaway.com’s share price
was €44.90. Prosus believes that one of the key drivers of Takeaway.com’s strong share price
performance since the transaction has been an increase in the share of orders from Low Competition
Markets, which has increased from 37 per cent. in the nine months to September 2018 to 65 per cent.
in H1 2019. Combining with Just Eat would reduce Takeaway.com’s share of orders in Low
Competition Markets to 28 per cent., (2) which is materially below pre-Germany deal levels. Prosus
believes that this indicates that there is a very meaningful downside risk to the valuation of the
combined entity.
(2)   Based on H1 2019 orders

                                                
The limited synergies that Takeaway.com and Just Eat have announced represent just 1.6 per cent.
of the combined cost base. These limited synergies do not, in Prosus’s view, compensate for the risks
outlined above. These synergies also primarily come from “operational and technology efficiency”,
which Prosus believes relies on the 3 per cent. headcount reductions referenced by Takeaway.com.
This is in contrast to Prosus’s focus on investment.

2.4     Takeaway.com’s playbook developed in Germany and the Netherlands would not
        address Just Eat’s challenges

Prosus believes that Takeaway.com takes a narrow view of the food delivery sector based principally
on its experience in the Netherlands and Germany. These markets have so far been relatively
insulated from innovative and well-funded global own-delivery competitors meaning Takeaway.com
has limited experience of competing against own-delivery players operating at scale.

In contrast, in the UK both Uber Eats and Deliveroo have been operating at scale for years with large
and growing market share and consumers have come to expect the superior selection and service
quality these platforms deliver. As just one example, 20 of the Tripadvisor top 50 ranked restaurants
in London are listed on Deliveroo or Uber Eats, compared to six of 50 listed on Just Eat. Prosus
believes this illustrates the ability of innovative own-delivery platforms to unlock superior selection for
customers, leading to increasing variety / frequency of delivery occasions and ultimately superior
growth compared to underinvesting marketplace incumbents.

Prosus believes that the severe market share loss suffered by Menulog in Australia at the hands of
the same two own-delivery competitors provides a cautionary tale for Just Eat in the UK and other
markets. If the consumer demand for superior selection and service quality provided through the own-
delivery model is not addressed, then Just Eat Shareholders may well face the same reality of
meaningful market share loss and value erosion, but on a much larger scale.

Prosus does not believe Takeaway.com is well-positioned to help Just Eat address this challenge. In
both Berlin and Amsterdam, Takeaway.com offers only four of the Tripadvisor top 50 restaurants on
its platforms. While this marketplace-driven approach has so far worked in Takeaway.com’s markets
given the absence or lack of focus of global own-delivery competitors, Prosus believes the UK
situation is different and Takeaway.com’s playbook will not help address the significantly higher
customer expectations in Just Eat’s markets.

2.5     Takeaway.com is not the right partner to help Just Eat transition to an own-delivery
        focused hybrid model

The Just Eat Board is now acknowledging that building a hybrid own-delivery / marketplace model is
required for long-term success. Takeaway.com has very limited own-delivery experience and no
meaningful track record, with an own-delivery order share of just 4.9 per cent. Takeaway.com’s
management has repeatedly stated that it believes own-delivery to be an inferior business model that
cannot be profitable, which in Prosus’s view is not true and reflects Takeaway.com’s lack of own-
delivery experience and narrow view of the food delivery industry restricted to the European markets
Takeaway.com operates in. Prosus is confident that the own-delivery model is profitable at scale, as
shown by the performance of Swiggy, Just Eat Canada, Meituan Dianping and Wolt, which profitably
operates an own-delivery model in a number of European markets.

Furthermore, Just Eat and Takeaway.com appear not to be aligned on own-delivery strategy. Just Eat
plans to leverage their “world-class Skip technology and operational know-how to build own-delivery
capabilities” while Takeaway.com intends to roll-out its “Scoober restaurant delivery services in the                                             
UK”. Just Eat and Takeaway.com also appear to disagree on the expected impact of such growth
investments on profitability. Just Eat acknowledges the potentially negative impact on profitability,
whilst Takeaway.com claims that the roll out of own delivery (Scoober) will have “no material negative
impact on the bottom line”.

These contradictions demonstrate the reactive nature of Just Eat and Takeaway.com’s response to
the changing dynamics in the sector raised by Prosus and represent a lack of strategic alignment and
consistency, highlighting the operational execution risk attached to Takeaway.com’s offer. In contrast,
Prosus has been consistent throughout in its stated strategy for Just Eat.

Prosus believes that its initial Offer to Just Eat Shareholders provided fair and certain value.
The Increased Offer provides even more compelling and certain value for Just Eat’s
Shareholders at a further premium to Takeaway.com’s all-share offer, which comes with
significant risk.

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in any
event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) 27 December 2019.

3.      Financing of the Increased Offer

The cash consideration payable by MIH pursuant to the Increased Offer will be financed by a bridge
loan agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV,
Citibank, N.A., London Branch, Citibank, N.A., Jersey Branch, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A.,
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.a., Filiale Frankfurt am Main as original
lenders (the Original Lenders), providing for a term loan bridge facility. The proceeds of the bridge
facility will be used to fund the cash consideration payable by MIH to Just Eat Shareholders in
connection with the Increased Offer. Prosus has secured the fully committed bridge financing from the
Original Lenders.

J.P. Morgan Cazenove, as financial adviser to Prosus and MIH, is satisfied that the resources
available to MIH are sufficient to enable it to satisfy in full the cash consideration payable to Just Eat
Shareholders under the terms of the Increased Offer.

4.      How to accept the Increased Offer

A revised offer document (the Revised Offer Document) containing the full terms of, and conditions
to, the Increased Offer together with the associated revised form of acceptance (the Revised Form of
Acceptance) will be posted to Just Eat Shareholders and be made available, subject to certain
restrictions relating to persons resident in Restricted Jurisdictions, on Prosus’s website at
www.prosus.com/investors/justeat, in due course.

Just Eat Shareholders wishing to accept the Increased Offer in respect of certificated Just Eat
Shares, should complete either (i) the Form of Acceptance accompanying the Offer Document
dated 11 November 2019? or (ii) the Revised Form of Acceptance which will accompany the
Revised Offer Document to be posted in due course.

Just Eat Shareholders wishing to accept the Increased Offer in respect of uncertificated
shares should do so electronically through CREST.

Pursuant to the terms of the Offer, Just Eat Shareholders who have already accepted the Offer
will automatically be deemed to have accepted the Increased Offer, by virtue of their prior
acceptance and do not need to take any further action.                                                  
If you have any questions relating to this announcement or the Offer Document, please contact the
Receiving Agent, Computershare on 0370 707 1066, (if calling within the UK) or on +44 370 707 1066
(if calling from outside the UK). Lines are open Monday to Friday 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. (London
time).

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in any
event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 27 December 2019.

5.         Level of acceptances and disclosure of interests in relevant securities

As at 3.00 p.m. on 6 December 2019, MIH had received valid acceptances of the Offer in respect of
12,295 Just Eat Shares representing approximately 0.0018 per cent. of the current issued share
capital of Just Eat, all of which may count towards the Acceptance Condition. MIH does not own any
Just Eat Shares.

The percentages of Just Eat Shares referred to in this announcement are based on a figure of
682,985,706(3) Just Eat Shares in issue on 6 December 2019.

(3)   Basic shares outstanding

6.         General

not form part of this announcement.

Code, the Panel, the Listing Rules, the London Stock Exchange and the FCA.

The Increased Offer will be being implemented solely pursuant to the terms of the Revised Offer
Document, which will contain further information about the Increased Offer.

This Announcement does not constitute a prospectus or prospectus exempted document.

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Increased
Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England and
Wales and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into
whose possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other
than the United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any
applicable requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United
Kingdom or the Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the
Increased Offer or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Increased Offer, may be affected by the
laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any
doubt regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their
relevant jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a
violation of the laws and/or regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the companies and other persons involved in the Increased Offer disclaim any
responsibility or liability for any violation of such restrictions by any person.

This Announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City
Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the
information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this
announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and
Wales and/or the Netherlands.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Increased Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable
transaction under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just
Eat Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law
and regulation, the Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or
indirectly in, into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile,
e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of
any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to
do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of
the Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction
or where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Increased Offer will not be
capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within a
Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of
that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the
Increased Offer are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise
forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction
where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents
(including agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute
or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so
would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme
(unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour of the
Scheme by any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Increased Offer will not be capable of
acceptance from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would
constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or
citizens of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11
November 2019.

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United
States by MIH and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their
respective affiliates will be making the Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the
Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to
purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at
prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent
with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019
and the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and
under applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of
the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US
securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is
substantial doubt as to the enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for
enforcement of judgments of US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws
and judgments of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Increased Offer or
passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United
States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the
tender offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the
case may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This Announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature
and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations,
targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks
and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the
future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All
statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as
“targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”,
”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will
look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-
saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative
thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or
results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding
future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-
looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.
Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH
respectively and no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been
correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

                                                   
Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking
statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or
regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation,
and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.



No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from
operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group
(as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just
Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely
in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a
securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of
any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant
securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must
contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and
rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed
under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no
later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If
two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are
required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

            calculated by multiplying the offered amount of 740 pence in cash per Just Eat Share by Just
            Eat’s fully diluted share capital (as referred to below).

(d)         The fully diluted share capital of Just Eat is 687,127,131 shares (as published by Just Eat in
            its circular to shareholders dated 25 November 2019).

(e)         The references made to Just Eat’s Board acknowledging the need for additional investment
            refer to the Chairman’s Letter as published by Just Eat in the circular to its shareholders
            dated 25 November 2019.

(f)         The values of the Takeaway.com Offer are calculated as:

      i.         the value of the Takeaway.com Offer as at 21 October 2019 of 594 pence per Just Eat
                 Share is obtained by:

            a)       dividing Takeaway.com’s Closing Price of €71.00 as at 21 October 2019 (being the
                     last Business Day prior to the date of the Offer Announcement) by the exchange rate
                     of £:€ of £1:€1.165 as at 21 October 2019 (being the last Business Day prior to the
                     date of the Offer Announcement) as derived from data provided by Bloomberg; and

            b)       multiplying the number obtained by the exchange ratio of 0.09744 Takeaway.com
                     Shares per Just Eat Share as set out in the announcement pursuant to Rule 2.7 of
                     the City Code released on 5 August 2019 in connection with the Takeaway.com
                     Offer; and

      ii.        the value of the Takeaway.com Offer as at 26 July 2019 of 731 pence is taken from the
                 announcement pursuant to Rule 2.7 of the City Code released on 5 August 2019 in
                 connection with the Takeaway.com Offer.

(g)         Grubhub's enterprise value / 2020 revenue is based on:

      i.         Grubhub’s enterprise value of US$4,199 million is calculated as Grubhub's equity value of
                 US$3,882 million (based on diluted shares outstanding of 94.7 million and share price of
                 US$41.01 as at 6 December 2019) plus net debt of US$317 million. 2020 revenue
                 reflects the Capital IQ broker consensus of US$1,461 million; and

      ii.        the illustrative value of Just Eat at the Grubhub 2020 enterprise value / revenue multiples
                 is for illustrative purposes only and should not be interpreted as a valuation estimate or
                 profit forecast under the Takeover Code. It is calculated by applying Grubhub’s enterprise
                 value / 2020 revenue multiple (as calculated above) of 2.9x to Just Eat’s 2020 consensus
                 revenue of £1,276 million (as detailed below) to obtain an illustrative enterprise value of
                 £3,699 million, and using net debt of £32 million, and other adjustments of £(63) million to                                                   
                 obtain an illustrative equity value of £3,614 million. Dividing by shares outstanding of 687
                 million obtains the illustrative share price of 526 pence per share.

(h)          Shareholder returns have been sourced from Bloomberg and reference the period from 21
             October 2016 to 21 October 2019.

(i)          Prior to acquiring Delivery Hero’s German assets in 2018, Takeaway.com’s share price was
             €44.90 (as at 20 December 2018).

(j)          Just Eat invested £51 million in growth initiatives in 2018 according to their H1 2019 investor
             presentation. This compares to a US$400 million multi-year investment commitment
             announced in November 2018 for iFood, US$200 million in marketing and delivery expansion
             in 2018 for Grubhub, and €350 million in growth initiatives in 2019 for Delivery Hero.

(k)          The less than £10 million investment in Menulog by Just Eat referenced by Prosus is calculated
             as their £19 million investment in Canada and Australia announced in Just Eat’s 2018 annual
             report, less the £12 million uEBITDA loss in Canada reported in their 2018 annual report. The
             Menulog writedown of £180 million was reported in Just Eat’s 2017 annual report. Menulog’s
             broker valuation of £104 million is the arithmetic average of the value assigned to Australia
             and New Zealand by those brokers available to Prosus which provide an SOTP valuation of
             Just Eat dated after 31 July 2019 (that being the date of Just Eat’s H1 2019 results). These
             brokers include:

       i.        Barclays (1 August 2019), Exane BNP Paribas (30 October 2019) and Macquarie (6
                 August 2019);

      ii.        the minimum ANZ valuation estimate per the consensus is £76 million, the maximum is
                 £128 million, and the arithmetic average is £104 million; and

      iii.       in accordance with Rule 28.8(c) of the City Code, the consensus estimates are not shown
                 with the agreement or the approval of Takeaway.com.

(l)          The source for Just Eat own-delivery orders referenced by Prosus is Just Eat’s H1 2019
             results presentation.

             defined as the highest Close Price on any given day after its first trading day following IPO on

             enterprise value of €5,481 million is calculated as Takeaway.com's equity value of €5,294
             million (based on total shares outstanding of 61.2 million as per the Just Eat Scheme
             Document and share price of €86.50 as at 6 December 2019) plus net debt of €166 million,
