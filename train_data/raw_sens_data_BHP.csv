    Euro Notes        XS1309436910                   €714,733,000            €461,102,000       €253,631,000




    (1) Assuming that all Notes tendered pursuant to the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures are validly delivered by the
        Guaranteed Delivery Deadline. The aggregate principal amount of US Dollar Notes tendered pursuant to the
        Guaranteed Delivery Procedures is US$1,500,000. No amount of Euro Notes were tendered pursuant to the
        Guaranteed Delivery Procedures.

Holders who tendered their Notes pursuant to the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures set out in the Tender
Offer Memorandum must deliver such Notes no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second
Business Day after the Expiration Deadline, being 25 November 2020 (such applicable date and time,
the “Guaranteed Delivery Deadline”).

Payment for the Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase (and, in the case of Notes tendered
pursuant to the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures, validly delivered by the Guaranteed Delivery Deadline)
will be made on the Settlement Date, expected to be 27 November 2020, the third Business Day after
the Expiration Deadline.

The Companies have an option to redeem remaining Notes of a Series at par plus any accrued
but unpaid interest following the purchase of at least 80 per cent. of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes of such Series issued on the “Issue Date” for such Series

As detailed further in the Tender Offer Memorandum, the terms and conditions of each Series allow the
relevant Company (subject to applicable laws) to redeem the Notes in that Series early (in whole but not
in part), at their outstanding principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest, if a “Substantial
Repurchase Event” occurs, meaning at least 80 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
of such Series issued on the “Issue Date” for such Series has been purchased by or on behalf of the
relevant Company and certain related parties of the relevant issuing Company.

Following settlement:
    (a) 88.75 per cent. of the total aggregate principal amount of the US Dollar Notes issued on the
        “Issue Date” for such Series will have been purchased by BHPB Finance (USA) Limited
        assuming that all US Dollar Notes tendered pursuant to the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures
        are validly delivered by the Guaranteed Delivery Deadline or 88.69 per cent. of the total
        aggregate principal amount of the US Dollar Notes issued on the ""Issue Date"" excluding any
        US Dollar Notes tendered pursuant to the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures; and
    (b) 66.18 per cent. of the total aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes issued on the “Issue
        Date” for such Series will have been purchased by BHPB Finance Limited.

Accordingly, at such time, a “Substantial Repurchase Event” will have been triggered in respect of the
US Dollar Notes and it is the current intention of BHPB Finance (USA) Limited to redeem the remaining
US Dollar Notes at their outstanding principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest, in
accordance with the US Dollar Notes’ terms and conditions, following settlement of the Offer for US
Dollar Notes. However, BHPB Finance (USA) Limited is not under any obligation to make any such
redemption and BHPB Finance (USA) Limited’s intention to do so may change at any time and for any
reason.

BHPB Finance Limited may choose to acquire outstanding Euro Notes by way of open market purchases
from time to time, but is under no obligation to make any such open market purchases. In addition, if
such open market purchases are made and a “Substantial Repurchase Event” is triggered in respect of
the Euro Notes, BHPB Finance Limited is not under any obligation to make any redemption pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Euro Notes.

The Companies shall also pay Accrued Interest (rounded to the nearest cent, with half a cent rounded
upwards) on all Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the relevant Offer(s).

The Offers will expire at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) today, 23 November 2020, unless extended,
reopened, amended and/or terminated by the relevant Company as provided in the Tender Offer
Memorandum (such applicable date and time, the “Expiration Deadline”).

Notes tendered may be withdrawn at any time prior to or at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) today, 23
November 2020, unless extended or otherwise amended in respect of any Offer by the relevant
Company in accordance with the Tender Offer Memorandum (such applicable date and time, the
“Withdrawal Deadline”) but not thereafter.

The relevant deadlines set by any intermediary or Clearing System will be earlier than these deadlines.
Tender Instructions (or, if applicable, Notices of Guaranteed Delivery) must be submitted in respect of
a minimum principal amount of Notes of the relevant Series of no less than the Minimum Denomination
for such Series, and may be submitted in integral multiples of US$1,000 or €1,000, as applicable. There
is no separate letter of transmittal in connection with the Tender Offer Memorandum.

The Offers are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, as set forth in the Tender Offer
Memorandum.

The Companies have an option to redeem remaining Notes of a Series at par plus any accrued
but unpaid interest following the purchase of at least 80 per cent. of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes of such Series issued on the “Issue Date” for such Series

The terms and conditions of each Series allow the relevant Company (subject to applicable laws) to
redeem the Notes in that Series early (in whole but not in part), at their outstanding principal amount
plus any accrued but unpaid interest, if a “Substantial Repurchase Event” occurs, meaning at least 80
per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such Series issued on the “Issue Date” for
such Series has been purchased by or on behalf of the relevant Company and certain related parties of
the relevant issuing Company. Such redemption will be subject to giving not less than 30 days’
irrevocable notice.

It is the current intention of each Company to redeem the remaining Notes of each Series at their
outstanding principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest, in accordance with the Series’ terms
and conditions, if a “Substantial Repurchase Event” is triggered in respect of such Series by the
purchase of any Notes pursuant to the relevant Offer(s). However, no Company is under any obligation
to make any such redemption and each Company’s intention to do so may change at any time and for
any reason.

Further, each Company may, if the “Substantial Repurchase Event” is not triggered by the purchase of
Notes pursuant to the Offer made by that Company, acquire outstanding Notes of the relevant Series
by way of open market purchases or otherwise and may, as a consequence, trigger a “Substantial
Repurchase Event”. However, no Company is under any obligation to make any such acquisition. Any
future purchases by either Company or its affiliates will depend on various factors existing at that time.

Guaranteed Delivery Procedures

A Holder who desires to tender its Notes but either cannot comply with the applicable procedures for
book-entry transfer or time will not permit such Notes to be tendered on or before the Expiration
Deadline, may effect a Tender pursuant to the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures set out in the Tender
Offer Memorandum.

The delivery of Notes tendered by the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures must be made no later than
5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day after the Expiration Deadline, expected to
be 25 November 2020 (such applicable date and time, the “Guaranteed Delivery Deadline”).

Release Number       21/20



NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION IN OR INTO, OR TO ANY PERSON
LOCATED OR RESIDENT IN OR AT ANY ADDRESS IN, ANY JURISDICTION WHERE IT IS
UNLAWFUL TO RELEASE, PUBLISH OR DISTRIBUTE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT (SEE ""LEGAL
NOTICES"" BELOW).

BHP launches further subordinated note repurchase plan

BHP announced today that, following the successful tender offers consummated in September 2020 in
respect of certain US dollar and euro subordinated notes issued in 2015, the Board has approved a
further global multi-currency subordinated repurchase plan, targeting any and all US dollar and euro
subordinated notes remaining in such series of subordinated notes issued in 2015. The multi-currency
plan aims to further reduce the group’s gross debt balance, reduce associated interest costs and
enhance the group’s capital structure by allocating surplus cash towards payment of the Notes pursuant
to the Offers.

In addition, to further the aims described above and as detailed below and in the Tender Offer
Memorandum, it is the current intention of each Company, following the Offers, to redeem the remaining
Notes of each Series at their outstanding principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest, in
accordance with the Series’ terms and conditions, if a “Substantial Repurchase Event” is triggered in
respect of such Series by the purchase of any Notes pursuant to the relevant Offer(s). Such “Substantial
Repurchase Event” shall occur when at least 80 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
of such Series issued on the “Issue Date” for such Series has been purchased by or on behalf of the
relevant Company and certain related parties of the relevant issuing Company. In this context, the Offers
therefore provide Holders with an opportunity to sell their Notes at a level substantially above the par
consideration that would be received by Holders in the event that a “Substantial Repurchase Event”
were to be triggered and the relevant Company were to redeem the Notes of the relevant Series.

No assurance can be given that the 80 per cent. threshold described above will or will not be met in
respect of any Series of Notes; however, the Companies note that, following the successful tender offers
consummated by the Companies in September 2020, the “Substantial Repurchase Event” shall be
triggered in respect of the US Dollar Notes with the purchase of a further US$295,768,000 in aggregate
principal amount of the US Dollar Notes (which is equivalent to 39.7 per cent. of the outstanding principal
amount of such US Dollar Notes) and in respect of the Euro Notes with the purchase of a further
€564,733,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes (which is equivalent to 79.0 per cent of
the outstanding principal amount of such Euro Notes) (in each case, considering the principal amount
of Notes outstanding on the Launch Date).

                 (1) For illustrative purposes only, a hypothetical Consideration for each Series is set out in the table above, based upon a
                     hypothetical Pricing Time as at 10.00 a.m. (New York City time) on 12 November 2020, where the hypothetical US
                     Dollar Notes Reference Yield was 0.409 per cent. and the hypothetical Interpolated Euro Mid-Swap Rate was -0.471
                     per cent., and assuming a Settlement Date of 27 November 2020. Holders should note that the actual Consideration
                     for each Series determined in the manner described in the Tender Offer Memorandum could differ significantly from the
                     hypothetical Consideration for each Series set out in the table above.
                 (2) The purchase price payable for each Series of Notes in the hypothetical event that a “Substantial Repurchase Event”
                     (as described herein) is triggered in respect of a Series and the relevant Company exercises its right to redeem the
                     Notes in such Series would be US$1,000 per US$1,000 in respect of the US Dollar Notes and €1,000 per €1,000 in
                     respect of the Euro Notes.


             The Offers will commence on 13 November 2020 (the “Launch Date”) and will expire, unless terminated
             earlier, at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on 23 November 2020 or at such other date or time to which
             either Offer may be extended, reopened, amended and/or terminated by the relevant Company as
             provided in the Tender Offer Memorandum (such applicable date and time, the “Expiration Deadline”).

             Notes tendered may be withdrawn at any time prior to or at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on 23
             November 2020, as may be extended or otherwise amended in respect of any Offer by the relevant
             Company in accordance with the Tender Offer Memorandum (such applicable date and time, the
             “Withdrawal Deadline”) but not thereafter.

             The relevant deadlines set by any intermediary or Clearing System will be earlier than these deadlines.
             Tender Instructions (or, if applicable, Notices of Guaranteed Delivery) must be submitted in respect of
             a minimum principal amount of Notes of the relevant Series of no less than the Minimum Denomination
             for such Series, and may be submitted in integral multiples of US$1,000 or €1,000, as applicable. There
             is no separate letter of transmittal in connection with this Tender Offer Memorandum.

             The Offers are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, as set forth in the Tender Offer
             Memorandum.

             The Companies have an option to redeem remaining Notes of a Series at par plus any accrued
             but unpaid interest following the purchase of at least 80 per cent. of the aggregate principal
             amount of Notes of such Series issued on the “Issue Date” for such Series

             The terms and conditions of each Series allow the relevant Company (subject to applicable laws) to
             redeem the Notes in that Series early (in whole but not in part), at their outstanding principal amount
             plus any accrued but unpaid interest, if a “Substantial Repurchase Event” occurs, meaning at least 80
             per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such Series issued on the “Issue Date” for
             such Series has been purchased by or on behalf of the relevant Company and certain related parties of
             the relevant issuing Company. Such redemption will be subject to giving not less than 30 days’
             irrevocable notice.

It is the current intention of each Company to redeem the remaining Notes of each Series at their
outstanding principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest, in accordance with the Series’ terms
and conditions, if a “Substantial Repurchase Event” is triggered in respect of such Series by the
purchase of any Notes pursuant to the relevant Offer(s). However, no Company is under any obligation
to make any such redemption and each Company’s intention to do so may change at any time and for
any reason.

Further, each Company may, if the “Substantial Repurchase Event” is not triggered by the purchase of
Notes pursuant to the Offer made by that Company, acquire outstanding Notes of the relevant Series
by way of open market purchases or otherwise and may, as a consequence, trigger a “Substantial
Repurchase Event”. However, no Company is under any obligation to make any such acquisition. Any
future purchases by either Company or its affiliates will depend on various factors existing at that time.

Consideration

The amount in cash to be paid by the relevant Company for each US$1,000 or €1,000 (as applicable)
in principal amount of each Series validly tendered pursuant to the relevant Offer prior to or at the
Expiration Deadline and accepted for purchase by the relevant Company shall be an amount (rounded
to the nearest cent, with US$0.005 and €0.005 (as applicable) being rounded upwards) that would
reflect, as of the Settlement Date, a yield to the First Reset Date of such Series equal to the sum of: (i)
the Reference Yield for such Series, plus (ii) the Fixed Spread for such Series set out in the above table
(in respect of each Series, the “Consideration”). The Reference Yield will be determined at the Pricing
Time on the Pricing Date with reference to, as applicable, the Reference Security or Reference
Interpolated Rate, as shown in the above table.

Specifically, the Consideration for each Series will equal (i) the value of all remaining payments of
principal and interest on the relevant Series up to and including the applicable First Reset Date
(assuming all outstanding Notes of the relevant Series are redeemed at their principal amount on the
applicable First Reset Date) discounted to the Settlement Date at a discount rate equal to the sum of (x)
the applicable Reference Yield plus (y) the applicable Fixed Spread, minus (ii) Accrued Interest.

The Companies shall also pay Accrued Interest (rounded to the nearest cent, with half a cent rounded
upwards) on all Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the relevant Offer(s).

Guaranteed Delivery Procedures

A Holder who desires to tender its Notes but either cannot comply with the applicable procedures for
book-entry transfer or time will not permit such Notes to be tendered on or before the Expiration
Deadline, may effect a Tender pursuant to the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures set out in the Tender
Offer Memorandum.

The delivery of Notes tendered by the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures must be made no later than
5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day after the Expiration Deadline, expected to
be 25 November 2020 (such applicable date and time, the “Guaranteed Delivery Deadline”).

BHP completes Shenzi Transaction

BHP today announced that it has completed the transaction to acquire an additional
28 per cent working interest in Shenzi from Hess Corporation (Hess), for US$505
million subject to the typical adjustment to reflect net cash generated from the 1 July
2020 transaction effective date to the close date of 6 November 2020.

The transaction brings BHP’s working interest to 72 per cent and adds approximately
11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production (90 per cent oil) as of the
transaction closing date of 6 November 2020.

Total petroleum production guidance for the 2021 financial year of between 95 and
102 MMboe will be updated at the second quarter Operational Review (released 20
January 2021 AEST) to reflect the additional production from Shenzi and other
operational updates such as Gulf of Mexico hurricane impacts.

Shenzi is a six-lease development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and is structured
as a joint ownership: BHP (Operator, 72 per cent interest) and Repsol S.A. (28 per
cent interest).

                            BHP OPERATIONAL REVIEW
                    FOR THE QUARTER ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2020

Note: All guidance is subject to further potential impacts from COVID-19 during
the 2021 financial year.

.    We continue to safely operate through the COVID-19 pandemic and deliver
     strong outcomes.
   
.    Group copper equivalent production increased by 2% in the September 2020
     quarter following strong performances in metallurgical coal and iron ore,
     with record production achieved at Jimblebar.
   
.    All production and unit cost guidance (based on exchange rates of AUD/USD
     0.70 and USD/CLP 769) remains unchanged for the 2021 financial year, except
     for Cerrejon production guidance which is under review due to an ongoing
     strike.
   
.    Our major projects under development in petroleum, copper and iron ore are
     tracking well. Atlantis Phase 3 achieved first production in July 2020,
     ahead of schedule and on budget. First production from the Spence Growth
     Option is expected between December 2020 and March 2021. The Jansen Stage 1
     project remains on track for final investment decision in the middle of the
     2021 calendar year. As a result of COVID-19 delays and the earlier
     challenges encountered on lining the shafts, we have approved incremental
     funding for completion of the current shaft lining project.
   
.    In petroleum, we have agreed to acquire an additional 28% interest in
     Shenzi, a tier one asset with optionality, at an attractive price. This
     transaction is consistent with our strategy of targeting counter-cyclical
     acquisitions in high-quality producing or near producing assets.
   
.    In copper exploration, the third phase of the drilling program at Oak Dam
     in South Australia delivered encouraging results, with further high grade
     mineralised intercepts of copper, with associated gold, uranium and silver
     confirmed. The project will now move to planning for early stage design
     evaluation and commencement of resource definition drilling in the first
     half of the 2021 calendar year.

                                     (9%)            1%    and higher seasonal demand at Bass Strait, partially offset by
                                                           lower volumes at Shenzi due to planned maintenance, the

                                     (4%)            0%    at Olympic Dam due to strong smelter performance and
                                                           recovery of production at Antamina following a six-week

Iron ore (Mt).................       66             66     Record quarterly production at Jimblebar and strong supply
                                      8%            (1%)   chain performance, offset by the impact from planned major car
                                                           dumper maintenance.

Metallurgical coal (Mt).......       10             10     Record truck and shovel stripping performance more than offset
                                      4%           (17%)   by the impact of significant planned wash plant maintenance

                   BHP Operational Review for               1
                   the quarter ended 30 September 2020

Summary

BHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry:

""BHP has started the new financial year with a strong first quarter of safety
and production performance. Group production rose two per cent from a year ago
driven by solid results in metallurgical coal and iron ore, our major growth
projects made good progress, and we secured more options in copper, nickel and
oil.

While our copper operations in South America continue to be impacted by
COVID-19 preventative measures, we achieved strong concentrator throughput at
Escondida and expect first production from the Spence Growth Option before the
end of March 2021. In Australia, Olympic Dam delivered its best quarterly
production in the past five years and we are on track for first production from
South Flank in the middle of the 2021 calendar year.

In petroleum, we have entered an agreement to increase our interest in the tier
one Shenzi asset while delivering first production from Atlantis Phase 3 ahead
of schedule and within budget. In copper, we secured an option agreement in the
Northern Territory in Australia and saw further promising exploration results
from Oak Dam. We bolstered our nickel options with an exploration alliance in
Canada and completion of the Honeymoon Well acquisition.

With a period of uncertainty to navigate, our efforts to be safer, more
reliable and lower cost are as important as ever. We are alive to the
challenges ahead but we look forward with confidence in our people and our
strategy.""

During the September 2020 quarter, Atlantis Phase 3 achieved first production
ahead of schedule and on budget. Given this, the progress of Atlantis Phase 3
will not be reported in future Operational Reviews.

The Jansen Stage 1 project in Canada is expected to be presented to the BHP
Board for Final Investment Decision in the middle of the 2021 calendar year. As
a consequence of the challenges encountered earlier with placement of the shaft
lining and then the more recent impacts from our COVID-19 response plan, the
Board has approved additional funding of US$272 million for the completion of
the shafts, resulting in a total budget of US$3.0 billion (previously US$2.7
billion). Jansen Stage 1 remains well positioned with attractive medium to
longer-term commodity fundamentals, and is set to be a high-margin, low-cost,
long-life asset, with multiple, basin-wide, expansion opportunities. As always,
we will be disciplined about our entry into the market and it must pass our
strict Capital Allocation Framework tests.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   BHP Operational Review for               2
                   the quarter ended 30 September 2020

At the end of the September 2020 quarter, BHP had five major projects under
development in petroleum, copper, iron ore and potash, with a combined budget
of US$10.9 billion over the life of the projects.

Corporate update

On 10 September 2020, BHP released its Climate Change Report, which provided an
update on its progress on climate action, new climate commitments, and how it
integrates climate change into corporate strategy and portfolio decisions.

Over the last month BHP has reduced gross debt by a total of US$2.9 billion. On
17 September 2020, BHP successfully concluded its US$1.9 billion multi-currency
hybrid repurchase program. The program was funded from surplus cash, and will
reduce future interest costs while also reducing the Group's gross debt
balance. The hybrid repurchase program was strongly value accretive due to the
reduction in interest costs associated with the hybrids being higher than the
premium paid to acquire the hybrids over par value. This premium over par value
generated an upfront accounting loss of approximately US$250 million (pre-tax),
which will be reported in net finance costs in the December 2020 half year. On
19 October 2020, BHP redeemed the US$1.0 billion of 6.250 per cent hybrid notes
at par on their first call date, also using surplus cash. BHP remains in a
strong liquidity position.

On 25 September 2020, BHP exercised the first, one-year extension option under
the Group's US$5.5 billion revolving credit facility, which has extended the
maturity date of the facility to 10 October 2025 at no additional cost.

On 13 October 2020, BHP and the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance
announced they have jointly agreed a path forward to enhance the influence and
voice of Traditional Owners in relation to heritage protection.

Good progress is continuing to be made with 12th Federal Court of Belo
Horizonte in Brazil which is seeking to expedite the remediation process
related to the Fundao dam failure, with recent judicial decisions regarding
financial assistance and compensation of impacted persons, as well as oversight
of other reparation programs. On 30 September 2020, the Federal and the Minas
Gerais State Public Prosecutors' Offices and the Federal, the Minas Gerais and
the Espirito Santo State Public Defenders' Offices filed a request to the 12th
Federal Court of Belo Horizonte for immediate resumption of the public civil
action filed in 2016. This claim had been suspended under a Governance
Agreement ratified on 8 August 2018, in which BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale
established a process to renegotiate the environmental and socio-economic
programs over two years to progress settlement of the R$155 billion
(approximately US$28 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim. BHP,
Samarco and Vale consider the resumption request without merit, given that
there was no default of obligations under the Governance Agreement. BHP,
Samarco and Vale remain committed to supporting the Renova Foundation and its
work to progress the remediation and compensatory programs to restore the
environment and re-establish communities affected by the Samarco tragedy.

Petroleum - Total petroleum production decreased by nine per cent to 27 MMboe.

Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production declined by eight per
cent to 12 MMboe. This reflects natural field decline across the portfolio and
the impacts of tie-in and commissioning activities at Atlantis, which was
partially offset with the earlier than scheduled achievement of first
production from the Phase 3 project.

Natural gas production decreased by nine per cent to 91 bcf, reflecting a
decrease in tax barrels at Trinidad and Tobago in accordance with the terms of
our Production Sharing Contract, end-of-field life at Minerva in the September
2019 quarter, lower domestic gas sales at Bass Strait and North West Shelf and
natural field decline across the portfolio. This decline was partially offset
by higher domestic gas sales at Macedon.

Production in the December 2020 quarter is expected to reflect tie-in activity
for the Trinidad and Tobago Ruby project and impacts from Hurricane Delta in
the Gulf of Mexico, with the potential risk of further impacts given the higher
than average active hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico.

On 6 October 2020, BHP signed a Membership Interest Purchase and Sale Agreement
with Hess Corporation to acquire an additional 28 per cent working interest in
Shenzi for US$505 million (subject to customary pre and post-closing
adjustments). The acquisition is consistent with our strategy of targeting
counter-cyclical acquisitions in high-quality producing or near producing
assets, and will bring BHP's working interest to 72 per cent. The effective
date of the transaction is 1 July 2020 with an expected close by December 2020,
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary and transaction-specific
conditions.

Total petroleum production guidance for the 2021 financial year remains
unchanged at between 95 and 102 MMboe. This will be updated to reflect the
additional production from Shenzi once the transaction is closed and the impact
of potential further weather events in the Gulf of Mexico during the December
2020 quarter.

In Trinidad and Tobago, the Deepwater Invictus rig is drilling ahead on the
Broadside-1 exploration well in the Southern licence.

In the US Gulf of Mexico, following Lease Sale 254, Blocks AC36, AC80 and AC81
in the western Gulf of Mexico were awarded in July 2020.

In the Gippsland Basin, we participated in a multi-client 3D seismic survey
(non-operated)/(2)/ that successfully completed in the September 2020 quarter.
Evaluation of the data is ongoing.

Petroleum exploration expenditure for the September 2020 quarter was
US$108 million, of which US$60 million was expensed. An approximately
US$450 million exploration and appraisal program is being executed for the 2021
financial year.

Copper - Total copper production decreased by four per cent to 413 kt. Guidance
for the 2021 financial year remains unchanged at between 1,480 and 1,645 kt.

For the September 2020 quarter, our Chilean assets operated with a reduction in
their operational workforces of approximately 30 per cent (versus approximately
35 per cent in the June 2020 quarter) as a result of the comprehensive plan we
have implemented for COVID-19. Our workforce are expected to remain at similar
levels during the December 2020 quarter.

Escondida copper production decreased by three per cent to 285 kt, with
continued strong concentrator throughput of 378 ktpd offset by lower cathode
production. The operating environment remains challenging, with a high degree
of uncertainty about the continued impacts from COVID-19 and expected
absenteeism levels. 

Guidance for the 2021 financial year remains unchanged at between 940 and 1,030 kt, and
reflects a decline in the copper grade of concentrator feed of approximately
four per cent, and the need to continue to balance mine development and
production requirements with processing capacity. Production is also likely to
be affected in the 2022 financial year as a result of the COVID-19 impact of a
reduced operational workforce leading to lower material movement in the 2021
financial year. Guidance of an annual average of 1.2 Mt of copper production
over the next five years remains unchanged.

Escondida’s Collective Agreement with Union N°2 of Supervisors and Staff expired on 
30 September 2020. On 16 October 2020, Escondida successfully completed negotiations 
with Union N°2 of Supervisors and Staff and signed a new Collective Agreement, 
effective for 36 months from 1 October 2020.

Pampa Norte copper production decreased by 33 per cent to 43 kt, largely due to
planned maintenance at Spence and the impact of a reduced operational workforce
due to COVID-19 preventative measures. Guidance for the 2021 financial year
remains unchanged at between 240 and 270 kt, and reflects the start-up of the
Spence Growth Option, partially offset by expected grade decline of
approximately seven per cent. Cerro Colorado is progressing in accordance with
its plan to reduce throughput and costs to achieve improved cash returns and
ensure viable mining operations for the remaining period of its current
environmental licence, which expires at the end of the 2023 calendar year.

Olympic Dam copper production increased 47 per cent to 52 kt, the highest
quarterly rate since the December 2015 quarter, supported by improved
underground mine productivity and strong smelter performance. The physical
replacement and commissioning of the refinery crane is scheduled to be
completed in the March 2021 quarter. Guidance for the 2021 financial year
remains unchanged at between 180 and 205 kt.

Antamina copper production decreased by eight per cent to 35 kt and zinc
production increased by 68 per cent to 34 kt, reflecting lower copper head
grades and higher zinc head grades, as well as the impacts of operating with a
reduced workforce due to COVID-19 preventative measures. While operations have
ramped up following a six-week COVID-19 related shutdown during the June 2020
quarter, Antamina continues to operate with a reduced workforce, which will
impact material mined in the 2021 financial year. Guidance remains unchanged
for the 2021 financial year, with copper production of between 120 and 140 kt,
and zinc production of between 140 and 160 kt.

The Spence Growth Option is on track to achieve first production between
December 2020 and March 2021. The commissioning of the desalination plant and
capitalisation of the associated US$600 million lease (approximate) is on track
to occur in the first half of the 2021 financial year.

At Olympic Dam, we continue to study options for expansion. Following more than
400 km of underground drilling associated with the Brownfield Expansion (BFX)
project studies, we have improved knowledge of the ore body's variability. This
has provided challenges for the economics of the BFX project, and we have
decided the optimal way forward for now is through targeted debottlenecking
investments, plant upgrades and modernisation of our infrastructure. We will
continue to study longer-term options for growth. Over the next two years, our
focus will remain on completing our asset integrity program. This will underpin
more stable operations and expected copper production of more than 200 ktpa.
The long-term opportunity for Olympic Dam is unchanged, with our enhanced
understanding of the resource in the Southern Mine Area and the promising
results from Oak Dam providing strong foundations for unlocking the full growth
potential of this asset.

Iron ore - Total iron ore production increased by eight per cent to 66 Mt (74
Mt on a 100 per cent basis). Guidance for the 2021 financial year remains
unchanged at between 244 and 253 Mt (276 and 286 Mt on a 100 per cent basis).

WAIO achieved higher volumes reflecting record production at Jimblebar and
strong performance across the supply chain. An uplift in car dumper reliability
and performance has been enabled by the BHP Operating System and improved
maintenance strategies. The ongoing program to improve productivity and provide
a stable base for our tightly coupled supply chain has progressed well with the
completion of a planned major maintenance campaign on car dumper three during
the September 2020 quarter. Production in the December 2020 quarter is expected
to be impacted by Mining Area C and South Flank major tie-in activity, and
maintenance on car dumper four, scheduled to align with the tie-in activity.

Mining and processing operations at Samarco remain suspended following the
failure of the Fundao tailings dam and Santarem water dam on 5 November 2015.
Restart can occur when the filtration system is complete and Samarco has met
all necessary safety requirements, and will be subject to final approval by
Samarco's shareholders.

Metallurgical coal - Metallurgical coal production increased four per cent to
10 Mt (17 Mt on a 100 per cent basis). Guidance for the 2021 financial year
remains unchanged at between 40 and 44 Mt (71 and 77 Mt on a 100 per cent
basis), although we are monitoring for any potential impacts from
restrictions on coal imports into China. With Blackwater back at full capacity
at the end of the September 2020 quarter, volumes will be weighted to the
second half of the financial year.

At Queensland Coal, strong underlying operational performance, including record
truck and shovel stripping, was partially offset by planned major wash plant
shutdowns at Blackwater, Goonyella, Saraji and Caval Ridge. Blackwater,
Queensland Coal's largest mine, was back at full capacity by the end of
September 2020, following recovery from significant wet weather impacts in the
March 2020 quarter.

Energy coal - Energy coal production decreased by 17 per cent to 5 Mt. Guidance
for the 2021 financial year is under review due to the ongoing strike at
Cerrejon.

NSWEC production was broadly unchanged at 4 Mt with significantly improved
truck productivity offset by a higher average strip ratio. Guidance for the
2021 financial year remains unchanged at between 15 and 17 Mt, although we are
monitoring for any potential impacts from restrictions on coal imports
into China. As a result of tropical cyclones in south-eastern Asia, several
shipments were delayed until early October 2020.

Cerrejon production decreased by 49 per cent to 1 Mt predominantly due to a
strike that started on 31 August 2020. Guidance for the 2021 financial year of
approximately 7 Mt is under review.

current scope of work is now US$3.0 billion.

Minerals exploration

Minerals exploration expenditure for the September 2020 quarter was
US$44 million, of which US$27 million was expensed. Greenfield minerals
exploration is predominantly focused on advancing copper targets within Chile,
Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Canada, South Australia and the south-west United States.

At Oak Dam in South Australia, the third phase of the exploration drilling
program continues to deliver encouraging results. Further high grade
mineralised intercepts of copper, with associated gold, uranium and silver,
were confirmed. Multiple intervals ranging between 0.24 and 4.20 per cent
copper were identified by laboratory assay results from 12 of the 14 drill
holes, totalling 21,543 metres. For further details refer to
Appendix 1. The exploration project will now be transferred to the Minerals
Australia Planning and Technical team for assessment, and next stage resource
definition drilling to inform future design is expected to commence in the
first half of the 2021 calendar year.

In August 2020, BHP signed an agreement with Midland Exploration to undertake a
nickel exploration alliance in north-eastern Quebec, Canada. The main objective
of this agreement is to identify, test and develop high quality exploration
targets towards the discovery of new significant nickel deposits.

In September 2020, BHP entered into an Option Agreement with Encounter
Resources covering the 4,500 km/2/ prospective Elliott Copper Project in the
Northern Territory, Australia. It provides BHP with the right, following the
completion of a jointly designed validation program, to enter an earn-in and
joint venture agreement to earn up to 75 per cent interest in Elliott by
spending up to A$22 million over 10 years.

BHP's acquisition of the Honeymoon Well tenements and a 50 per cent interest in
the Albion Downs North and Jericho exploration joint ventures was also
completed in September 2020. The Honeymoon Well increases Nickel West's
position in one of the world's major Nickel sulphide provinces and the
exploration joint ventures provide us with new access to prospective tenements.
Several deposits are under consideration and are expected to be included in
Nickel West long term plans in the future.

Project Status Update

Between November 2019 and June 2020, a 14 diamond hole follow-up program
totalling 21,542.5 metres was completed at Oak Dam, located 65 kilometres to the
south east of BHP’s operations at Olympic Dam in South Australia (Figure 1).
Figure 2 describes the location of the phase three new drilling and Figure 3
shows the new drilling on cross sections.

Laboratory assay results confirm further mineralised intercepts of copper with
associated gold, uranium and silver metals, as per the table below, with further
detail included within this appendix.

Geology and Mineralisation

Phase three drilling continues to confirm IOCG-style alteration and
mineralisation described previously (BHP Copper Exploration Update/(1)/ dated 27
November 2018 and BHP Operational Review dated 17 October 2019/(2)/), with a
core of barren hematite-quartz breccias approximately central to the gravity
anomaly, surrounded by high-grade chalcocite and bornite mineralisation, which
grades outwards to more dominant chalcopyrite and pyrite mineralisation, towards
the contact with the host rocks. The simplified geology is shown in three
representative cross sections in Figure 3.

Further Work

BHP continues to evaluate the results reported to date to inform the next
phase of work expected to begin in the first half of the 2021 calendar year.

Drilling Techniques

.    All drilling was diamond drilling from surface.

.    Parent holes were collared in HWT to a depth of 6m and continued in PQ
     until the Tregalona Shale unit in the post mineral cover (between 100 m and
     150 m downhole depth). From the Tregalona Shale, drilling continued in HQ
     to the depth chosen to begin navigational drilling. Navigational drilling
     was completed on the parent hole (and subsequent wedges) to setup for one
     to two wedges off parents AD29, AD31, AD30 and AD32. AD27W4 was wedged off
     AD27 parent hole from the previous drilling campaign. AD33 was drilled from
     surface without navigational drilling.

.    Directional surveys using a north-seeking gyroscope were completed on each
     hole inside the NQ2 rods.

Location of data points

.    All drill hole collar locations (historic and recent) have been surveyed
     with Trimble R8s and manually entered into acQuire database.

.    All coordinates provided are measured and provided in Geocentric Datum of
     Australia 1994 (GDA94 Zone 53).

Geological Logging

.    100% of new drill holes were logged in qualitative detail for the basement
     rocks.

.    The following observations were recorded: lithology composition and
     texture, alteration minerals and sulphide distribution.

.    Structural measurements have been recorded from orientated core measuring
     alpha and beta angles of structures of interest.

.    Core was photographed both wet and dry.

.    Geotechnical logging for rock-quality designation, micro-defects and rock
     classification commenced during the phase three drilling program.

Sampling Techniques

.    Sample recoveries are visually estimated to be >97%.

.    Sample loss is not considered material to reported grades.

.    Diamond core was split by core saw, with half the core submitted for assay
     and the other half stored in trays at Olympic Dam. Samples are submitted as
     1 m or 2 m intervals.

.    Specific gravity measurements were taken for all assayed samples.

.    6-8 kg samples were submitted to an analytical laboratory for final drying,
     staged crushing to 2 mm, splitting to approximately 3 kg portion, followed
     by pulverisation to 90% passing 75 micron particle size pulp.

.    Duplicate samples were collected at each preparation stage where a
     reduction in sample mass occurred.

                   BHP Operational Review for               27
                   the quarter ended 30 September 2020

Quality of assay data and laboratory tests

.    All samples were submitted to Intertek/Genalysis Laboratory in Adelaide.

.    All new drill holes reported here were analysed for Cu, Ag, As, Bi, Co, Zn,
     Ni, Pb, Al, Ca, Cr, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Sc, Si, Ti, V, Ba, Mo, Sb, Sr, U,
     Y, Zr, Au, S, Ce, La, using 3-acid digest, total fusion, fire assay and
     induction furnace digestions followed by ICP-OES/MS or infrared methods.

.    Three acid digestion followed by ICP-OES/MS was used to measure Cu, Ag, As,
     Co, Zn, Ni, Pb.

.    Lithium borate fusion followed by ICP-OES/MS was to measure Al, Ca, Bi, Cr,
     Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Sc, Si, Ti, V, Ba, Mo, Sb, Sr, U, Y, Zr.

.    Comparative analysis between four and three acid digest methods, for a
     reduced suite of thirty-three elements, demonstrates that equally accurate
     and representative geochemistry and characterisation of the mineral system,
     was possible compared to the four acid digest method and sixty-three
     element suite, reported previously (BHP Exploration Results Update dated 27
     November 2018).

.    25 g fire assay with an ICP-OES finish was used to measure Au.

.    Induction furnace combustion followed by infrared analyser was used to
     measure C and S.

.    Quality control samples consisted of duplicates (1:25), analytical blanks
     (1:50) and certified standards (1:25). QC results reviewed when results are
     received, all performed within acceptable accuracy and precision limits.

Verification of sampling and assaying

.    Significant intersections were validated via visual re-inspection of drill
     core, followed up by optical microscopy by BHP personnel not involved with
     the initial geological logging of the drill core. There has been no
     adjustments to the assay data that is electronically uploaded to the
     database from the commercial laboratory.

.    All drill hole data is managed internally using computerised geological
     logging, a comprehensive SQL server relational database, and strict
     validation rules.

.    The database has a security model which requires user access to have
     supervisor approval. The database is backed up regularly by standard backup
     procedures.

.    No twinned holes have been drilled.

Sample security

.    A reconciliation is completed between the sampling request and drilling
     plods to ensure that any lost core is accurately recorded prior to
     sampling. Sample numbers are automatically generated directly from the
     database once the sampling request is visually validated against the drill
     core. Laboratory sample receipt is recorded in the database. The laboratory
     reconciles samples received against samples requested on the assay request
     sheet.

Audits or reviews

.    The drill hole database is structured and controlled in the same way as the
     Olympic Dam database which has been independently audited.

Orientation of data in relation to geological structure

.    Mineralisation at this stage is still not well defined as per the irregular
     nature in IOCG-type deposits.

.    New holes have been angled approximately northwest-southeast to east-west,
     drilled from outside of the centre of the hydrothermal system, aiming to
     test the eastern and western contacts with the host rock.

Data aggregation methods

.    All intersections are length and density weighted represented in apparent
     (downhole) widths, true widths of intersections are unknown.

.    There is insufficient drilling to provide any mineral inventory estimate
     (including Exploration Target).

                   the quarter ended 30 September 2020

Mineral tenement and land tenure status

.    The project is located within the Exploration Licence 5941 (EL5941), 100%
     owned by BHP.

.    EL5941 was successfully renewed in February 2019 within the current five
     year term, which expires on 21 February 2022, when a subsequent application
     will be lodged.

.    EL5941 is in ‘good standing’ with recent historic minimum expenditure met
     or exceeded.

Exploration done by other parties

.    The project has a long exploration history, dating back to 1976 by Western
     Mining Corporation and BHP.

.    All drilling information prior to 2018 has not been through the same
     quality control and processes described in this release and uncertainties
     exist in respect to the survey (dip, azimuth).

.    Historic drill holes have been re-sampled using the same methodologies and
     processes as the 2018 drill holes.

1. In calculating the results of the respective polls under the joint electoral procedure, “withheld” votes at BHP Group Plc’s meeting are
aggregated with “abstained” votes at BHP Group Limited’s meeting. For all relevant purposes “withheld” votes and “abstained” votes
have the same meaning. They are not included in the calculation of the proportion of votes for and against each resolution.

2.Proxy figures for Resolution 24 are included below in Appendix 1 for information.

3. BHP engaged extensively with investors throughout 2020 on the Company’s approach to industry associations. This engagement
directly shaped the package of industry association reforms that BHP announced in August 2020, which was welcomed by Climate
Action 100+ and the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors. BHP also consulted broadly with investors on Resolution 25, and
will undertake further consultations over the next few months with shareholders that voted for and against Resolution 25 to better
understand the reasons for their position.

Ken MacKenzie, Chair

An uncertain world

Engaging with shareholders is one of the most important parts of my role as Chair. It is
your feedback that truly sharpens our focus on what matters most. I’ve enjoyed these
interactions over the last year - whether it be through retail forums, or the meetings I’ve
had with institutional investors all around the world.

I am also pleased that we have found new ways to connect, despite the challenges of the
year. In fact over the last three months, we have had an unprecedented amount of
engagement with our shareholders. We’ve held two BHP Live events, a retail forum for UK
shareholders, two sustainability roundtable sessions, two Indigenous heritage
roundtables, and a climate change briefing.

This engagement has been invaluable. Thank you.

When I spoke to you at our 2019 AGM I said ‘success is never assured’ and ‘we work in
an uncertain world’. Unfortunately, the past 12 months have demonstrated the extent of
that uncertainty.

Chile has been shaken by social unrest; Australia has been hit hard by bushfires; the
COVID-19 pandemic has affected billions of people and changed our way of life; most
major economies – other than China – are in recession, leaving millions of people out of
work; and there has been significant commodity price volatility.

Financial highlights

As I said, this is an uncertain world – but, despite the global adversity, BHP performed
solidly in the 2020 financial year:

   -   Earnings and cash flow were strong;
   -   Net debt was at the low end of our target range;
   -   Productivity was up;
   -   Unit costs were down; and
   -   We delivered US$6.1 billion in dividends to shareholders.

CEO transition

We also appointed Mike Henry as Chief Executive Officer, replacing Andrew Mackenzie
who retired as CEO on 31 December 2019.
Under Andrew’s leadership, BHP became a simpler and more disciplined company. We
thank him for his vision and hard work, which has changed the way we operate and
engage with the world.

Mike Henry is a leader of integrity with exceptional standards and an uncompromising
commitment to safety. He is a true professional with significant operational and
commercial experience at BHP, and he has a deep passion for your company.

We will hear from Mike shortly.

An essential company

This is a time of great opportunity for BHP. Because as great as the challenges the world
is facing, we know the answer to many of them can be found in the very resources we
produce.

Our products are essential for global economic growth and the transition to a lower carbon
world. We provide the materials that improve the lives of billions of people in developing
nations, and help engineers realise the dream of cleaner power, more efficient
transportation, communications and battery storage.

This is what we do.

This is BHP’s guiding motivation, and it is why we proudly commit to our purpose – to
bring people and resources together to build a better world.

Priorities

We have the confidence to deliver on this purpose because of our strong foundations.

When I first spoke to you as Chair in 2017, I detailed five priorities for the future of BHP:
Safety, Portfolio, Capital discipline, Capability and culture, and Social value.

These priorities have not changed.

Safety is still our top priority – and I am pleased that our Total Recordable Injury
Frequency improved in 2020 and, most importantly, we did not have any fatalities on our
sites.

We continue to sharpen our portfolio by focusing on future-facing commodities and assets
that will deliver the greatest long-term value to shareholders. This is why we have
strengthened our copper and nickel holdings and announced our intent to divest our
interests in a number of coal assets whose value may be best realised outside of BHP.

We remain relentless on capital discipline and will continue to be guided by our Capital
Allocation Framework. This helps us to direct capital between investments, the balance
sheet and cash returns to shareholders, such as dividends.

We also keep building on one of our core strengths – the capability and culture of the
company and its people. At Board level, this process continued over the year with a
number of key appointments.

Your Board

Gary Goldberg has joined the Board, bringing with him more than 35 years of global
mining industry experience.

Following the work we did on our Skills and Experience Matrix in 2018, we identified an
opportunity to enhance the technology expertise on our Board. As a result, in May we
announced the appointment of Dion Weisler and Xiaoqun Clever.

Dion has extensive global executive experience, including as the President and Chief
Executive Officer of HP Inc.

Xiaoqun has over 20 years of global experience in technology with a focus on software
engineering, data and analytics, cybersecurity and digitalisation.

I am also delighted to welcome Christine O’Reilly to the Board this week. She will bring
deep financial and public policy expertise, as well as valuable insights in large-scale
capital projects and transformational strategy.

Retiring board members

Finally, I would also like to acknowledge Lindsay Maxsted and Shriti Vadera – both
members of the Board for more than nine years. I thank Lindsay for his counsel and for
his exceptional contribution to the Board and as Chair of the Risk and Audit Committee.
Lindsay retired in September.

I also thank Shriti for her support to me as Senior Independent Director, and her
commitment to our shareholders. Shriti has made an outstanding contribution to BHP and
is retiring after the AGMs.

Thank you Lindsay and Shriti.

When we get the first four priorities right – safety, portfolio, capital discipline, and
capability and culture – we are a stronger, more focussed and more efficient company.

Social value

But none of that matters if we fail in our fifth priority: to generate real social value in the
countries and communities where we operate.

In 2020:
    - We invested almost US$150 million in social value initiatives. This includes the
       Vital Resources Fund that we stood up to support regional Australian communities
       during the pandemic.
    - We spent almost US$2 billion on our local buying program, and we accelerated
       payments of US$100 million, to small, local and Indigenous businesses when they
       needed it most.
    - We also boosted our Indigenous workforce participation to 6.5 per cent in Australia
       and 6.6 per cent in Chile – exceeding our targets.
    - And we paid US$9 billion in taxes, royalties and other payments to governments
       around the world – an effective tax rate of over 42 per cent.

Traditional Owners

At our last AGM, I said that our relationships with Traditional Owners are among the most
important that BHP has. Recent industry events only reinforce that view, so I’d like to
update you on our engagement with Indigenous communities.
In Australia, BHP has continued our work with Traditional Owners, and more recently the
First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance, to build our shared vision for the future.

Together we have developed principles around Indigenous Heritage in Australia,
reaffirming our policy and commitment to Free, Prior and Informed Consent in agreement
making, and that regulatory regimes should respect and reflect this right.

We have also set new aspirations for cultural heritage keeping places to even better
advance Traditional Owners’ values, culture and pride. Places where artefacts can be
stored and visited, and also places of knowledge, learning and celebration of the unique
living cultures they are connected to.

I want to acknowledge the Traditional Owners, Indigenous leaders and Aboriginal Land
Councils that have engaged with us.

I look forward to our continuing partnership to deliver the commitments we have made
together, and our shared objectives.

Future focused

BHP’s approach to social value shows up locally - through our support of the communities
where we operate - but also globally, where we are actively addressing some of the
world’s most complex challenges, such as climate change.

This is something that we have been addressing for decades.

We were one of the first resource companies in the world to set targets for Scope 1 and 2
emissions, and last year we established a US$400 million program to invest in low
emissions technologies.

We recently made a number of announcements that demonstrate the next step in
responding to this challenge, because we know we have a responsibility to reduce
emissions from our own operations, and help communities and countries decarbonise
their economies.

We are acting on this responsibility.

We have set out clear targets and goals, based on thorough analysis, and most
importantly, shared how we will deliver on these outcomes.

There is no easy route to a net zero world.

But BHP is committed to the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals – because it is good for business and our stakeholders.

Strength and resilience

In conclusion, let me come back to uncertainty.

The world may be uncertain, but many things at BHP are not. We are certain in the
strength, resilience and quality of our people – who showed real purpose in 2020.

We are certain that the resources we produce are essential. They are fundamental to the
way we live now and into the future, they are crucial to economic development, and critical
to the transition to a lower carbon world. We are confident that our disciplined focus on
our core priorities will allow BHP to sustainably create value for the long term.

Thank you.

I’ll now hand over to your CEO, Mike Henry.


Mike Henry, Chief Executive Officer

Introduction

Thank you, Ken, and welcome to everyone joining us online today.

It is hard to believe that it has been almost a year since I was announced as BHP’s Chief
Executive.

It’s an honour to be entrusted by the board and shareholders to lead this company.

BHP is an essential company

I have spent my whole career in the resources industry and have been with BHP for
almost two decades. Our refreshed purpose statement, developed last year, ‘To bring
people and resources together to build a better world’ perfectly talks to why I am here.

BHP is a company that is, indeed, steeped in history…but we are not constrained by it. As
we have done for over a century now, we continue to evolve and lead for the times.

We provide the resources that are essential to improving lives around the world. We
support tens of thousands of direct jobs, and many more through the business
opportunities we create for others. Our operations provide the lifeblood for many regional
communities.

Young people are able to join us, grow their careers and build lives for themselves and
their loved ones. Our shareholders rely on the value we create and our consistent
generation of strong cash returns.

We do so supported by access to people, resources, and capital – your investment in us.
BHP must be a company that governments and communities trust, and where great
people want to work. We must be a company investors are confident in and find attractive
because we generate strong value and returns, in the right way.

My commitment to you is to lead in a way that ensures all of these are so. Our focus on
social value will ensure that all stakeholders benefit from our existence, and that
communities trust in us. We will hire great people, invest in them and have a culture that
supports exceptional performance.

And, we will protect and grow shareholder value over the short, medium and long term.
This includes through the deliberateness we bring to how we shape our portfolio to
manage risk and maximise upside to the trends underway around us.

We performed strongly over the past year

Our strategy, portfolio, relationships and team are strong. This was evident in our results
over the past year and in how we have navigated the challenges that Ken spoke of.

In spite of these challenges, we achieved a safe year with zero fatalities in our operations
and strong financial performance. This was possible because of the remarkable way in
which people across BHP stepped up, and because of the support we were afforded by
our host communities, governments, business partners and traditional owners.

We also sought to support those who rely on BHP: we shortened payment terms for small,
local and Indigenous suppliers, provided new health and social funds in our host
communities, and we created an additional 1,500 temporary jobs. In addition, the BHP
Foundation is funding vaccine and treatment research.

Our strong performance has resulted in a number of our operations achieving record
production or throughput and we achieved lower unit costs across all of our major
assets.

We produced strong operational cash flow, and through our disciplined application of our
capital allocation framework we concurrently invested in growth; maintained a strong
balance sheet with net debt at the bottom of our range; and returned over US$6 billion to
shareholders for the third year in a row, which included an additional amount of US$1.5
billion over our minimum 50 per cent payout ratio.

We are tackling the global challenges most critical to our business

We continue to stretch our performance and leadership on challenges the world is facing
and that are important to BHP’s long-term value creation and to our shareholders.

We have demonstrated sector-leadership in climate change action for over two decades
and, as Ken mentioned, just last month we announced our next series of commitments,
including a 30 per cent reduction in operational emissions in the next decade, on path to
becoming net zero by 2050.

We have recently made bold moves on renewable energy, as well as on water
stewardship, including a shift to 100 per cent desalinated water and renewable power at
our Escondida and Spence operations in Chile.

We have grown female participation in our workforce by two percentage points in the past
year, to 26.5 per cent, which is in the order of 50 per cent higher than our peers.

We continue to invest in indigenous employment and grew representation in our workforce
over the year. In Australia, the proportion of people who identify as indigenous in BHP is
now around twice that of society overall.

We are looking to double the proportion of people who have permanent employment
with BHP and we have also recently announced funding and support for 3,500 new
apprenticeships and training opportunities in Australia over the next five years.

We have a strong portfolio that we will continue to shape for the future

As we look to the future, we remain confident the world will continue to need the
commodities we produce. However, we also recognise that the world is dynamic and
changing.

Global trends such as the electrification of transport, decarbonisation of power, population
growth and rising standards of living are expected to drive demand for copper, nickel and
potash – future facing commodities – even as growth in demand for iron ore, metallurgical
coal and oil and gas slows.

And, we are actively managing our portfolio to protect and grow value. This includes
creating more options in future facing commodities for long-term growth and tending to our
current portfolio to maximise the value of our assets.

Through our rigorous approach to capital allocation, we will create and secure more
options through innovation, exploration, early stage entry and well-timed acquisitions of
attractive resources and assets.

We have already made some progress here, adding copper and nickel options to our
portfolio earlier in the year, and we are progressing towards a final investment decision on
our potash project in Canada next year.

In terms of our existing portfolio, we recently announced steps to optimise our coal
portfolio through focusing on high-quality hard coking coal and divesting our other coal
operations.

And, as part of our balanced approach to investing in Petroleum, we recently grew our
working interest in Shenzi but we also shared our intent to divest from more mature, later
life assets, including our non-operated interest in the Bass Strait joint venture.

As we shape our portfolio for the future, it is incredibly important that we deliver
exceptional safety, operational and financial performance.

In the face of market uncertainty and slowing rates of growth in commodity demand, a
greater proportion of value growth will come from an unrelenting focus on being great at
what we do.

We remain committed to the capital discipline we have demonstrated in recent years and
will further build upon our technical and operational capability. The revised shape of the
Executive Leadership Team will bring operational and technical excellence to the fore,
along with our focus on our portfolio and social value.

Momentum is with us and we are well-positioned for the year ahead

In the near term, we expect that the global economy will take some time to stabilise and
recover from COVID-19.

Given the variable nature of the pace and structure of the recovery around the world and
exacerbated by global trade tensions, the outlook for commodity markets remains
uncertain. However, the strength and consistency of the economic recovery underway in
China does provide a measure of confidence and optimism.

BHP’s performance in the past year illustrates the resilience of our portfolio, balance
sheet, people and relationships. We are very well positioned to weather uncertainty and to
emerge from COVID-19 stronger, faster-paced and more focused.

BHP will continue to grow value

So, thank you. Thank you for the trust that you place in our company.
These are deeply uncertain times for the world and are likely to continue for some time.

The way our people have stepped up to meet these challenges has been truly inspiring.
Their leadership and dynamism, with the support from our valued relationships, has
enabled us to deliver a year that was safer, lower cost and with strong returns.

As the world rebuilds and aspires to a more sustainable future, BHP will continue to
evolve and lead the industry in a way that grows value and returns for you, our
shareholders, indeed, for all our stakeholders.

Thank you again for your interest and continued support for our company.

Back to you, Ken.

Release Number     16/20


BHP to acquire an additional 28 per cent working interest in Shenzi from Hess

BHP today announced that it has signed a Membership Interest Purchase and Sale
Agreement with Hess Corporation (Hess) to acquire an additional 28 per cent
working interest in Shenzi, a six-lease development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Shenzi is structured as a joint ownership: BHP (Operator, 44 per cent interest); Hess
(28 per cent interest) and Repsol S.A. (28 per cent interest).

BHP and Hess have agreed to a purchase price of US$505 million, subject to
customary pre and post-closing adjustments.

The acquisition would bring BHP’s working interest to 72 per cent and immediately
add approximately 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production (90 per cent
oil).

This transaction is consistent with our strategy of targeting counter-cyclical
acquisitions in high-quality producing or near producing assets. While our strict
Capital Allocation Framework tests ensure all investments are resilient to low points
in the commodity cycle, we also recognise the potential for price upside over the
medium term given the global slowdown in development activity, and we are well
positioned to participate in that upside. We continue to believe that the fundamentals
for oil and advantaged gas will be attractive for the next decade and likely beyond.

BHP President Petroleum Operations, Geraldine Slattery said: “This transaction
aligns with our plans to enhance our petroleum portfolio by targeted acquisitions in
high quality producing deepwater assets and the continued de-risking of our growth
options. We are purchasing the stake in Shenzi at an attractive price, it’s a tier one
asset with optionality, and key to BHP’s Gulf of Mexico heartland. As the operator, we
have more opportunity to grow Shenzi high-margin barrels and value with an
increased working interest.”

The effective date of the transaction is 1 July 2020 with an expected close by
December 2020, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary and transaction-
specific conditions.

               The FX Rate at the Pricing Time was €1.00 = US $1.1808.


               Offer Cap, Acceptance Priority Levels and Pro-Rating Factors


               The Tenders validly submitted and not withdrawn by the Early Tender Deadline exceeded the Offer Cap
               of US$1,900,000,000.


               As further described in the Tender Offer Memorandum, the aggregate principal amount of each Series
               that will be purchased pursuant to the Offers has been determined in accordance with the Acceptance
               Priority Levels, with Acceptance Priority Level 1 being the highest and Acceptance Priority Level 2 being
               the lowest. The Companies have accepted all US Dollar Notes validly tendered pursuant to the relevant
               Offer, having Acceptance Priority Level 1, before any validly tendered Euro Notes, having Acceptance
               Priority Level 2.


               As the total amount payable (excluding Accrued Interest) for validly tendered Euro Notes would (together
               with the total amount payable (excluding Accrued Interest) for validly tendered US Dollar Notes), if all
               such Euro Notes were purchased, exceed the Offer Cap, the Euro Notes have been accepted on a pro-
               rata basis such that total amount payable (excluding Accrued Interest) for all Notes validly tendered in
               the Offers and accepted for purchase does not exceed the Offer Cap. The Pro-Rating Factor applied
               to the Euro Notes is set out in the table above.


               The total Final Acceptance Amount (in the case of the Euro Notes, by converting the principal amount
               of Euro Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the relevant Offer into US Dollars
               at the FX Rate) is US$ 1,545,875,273.60.


               Although the Offers are scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York time, on 30 September 2020, as
               the Offer Cap has been reached by the Early Tender Deadline, no Notes tendered after the Early Tender
 Deadline will be purchased pursuant to the Offers regardless of the Acceptance Priority Level of such
 Notes.


 Early Settlement


 The Early Settlement Date for the Notes accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers, as set out in the
 above table, is expected to be 21 September 2020, the third Business Day after the Early Tender
 Deadline. Holders will also receive Accrued Interest on the Notes validly tendered and accepted for
 purchase in the Offers from (and including) the immediately preceding interest payment date for such
 Notes to (but excluding) the Early Settlement Date, in each case determined in accordance with the
 terms and conditions of the relevant Series.


 Notes not accepted for purchase will be promptly returned to the tendering Holders or, in the case of
 Notes tendered by book-entry transfer, such Notes will be promptly credited to the account maintained
 at the relevant Clearing System from which Notes were delivered.

Early results in BHP’s subordinated note repurchase plan

BHP announced today the early results of its global multi-currency subordinated note repurchase plan.

BHP Billiton Finance (USA) Limited (“BHPB Finance (USA) Limited”) and BHP Billiton Finance Limited
(“BHPB Finance Limited” and, together with BHPB Finance (USA) Limited, the “Companies” and each
a “Company”) today announced the early results of BHP’s global multi-currency subordinated note
repurchase plan, announced on 2 September 2020, which includes:

    (a) an invitation by BHPB Finance (USA) Limited to eligible holders of its outstanding
        US$2,250,000,000 6.750 per cent. Subordinated Non-Call 10 Fixed Rate Reset Notes due 2075
        guaranteed by BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc (the “Parent Companies”) (ISIN:
        US055451AX66 (Rule 144A) / USQ12441AB91 (Reg S)) (the “US Dollar Notes”); and
    (b) an invitation by BHPB Finance Limited to eligible holders of its outstanding €750,000,000 5.625
        per cent. Subordinated Non-Call 9 Fixed Rate Reset Notes due 2079 guaranteed by BHP Group
        Limited and such Notes and such guarantee being guaranteed by BHP Group Plc (ISIN:
        XS1309436910) (the “Euro Notes”; the Euro Notes and the US Dollar Notes each being a
        “Series”, and any notes within any such Series being the “Notes”, and the eligible holders of any
        Notes, the “Holders”),

to offer to tender such Notes for repurchase by the relevant Company for cash (together, the “Offers”),
on the terms and conditions set out in a tender offer memorandum dated 2 September 2020 prepared
by the Companies in connection with the Offers (the “Tender Offer Memorandum”). Capitalised terms
not defined in this announcement have the meanings given to them in the Tender Offer Memorandum.

The Early Tender Deadline for the Offers was 5:00 p.m., New York time, on 16 September 2020 (the
“Early Tender Deadline”). The Withdrawal Deadline was 5:00 p.m., New York time, on 16 September
2020. As a result, tendered Notes may no longer be withdrawn, except in certain limited circumstances
as detailed further in the Tender Offer Memorandum.
       
As at the Early Tender Deadline, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by Holders was:

             (a) pursuant to the Offer made in respect of the US Dollar Notes, US$1,504,232,000, representing
                 66.85 per cent. of the total aggregate principal amount of the US Dollar Notes; and
             (b) pursuant to the Offer made in respect of the Euro Notes, €469,771,000, representing 62.64 per
                 cent. of the total aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes.

The Tenders validly submitted and not withdrawn by the Early Tender Deadline exceeded the Offer Cap
of US$1,900,000,000.

The Companies hereby announce their indicative and non-binding intention (subject to confirmation by
the Companies in their sole and absolute discretion) to accept valid tenders of Notes in the Series as
set out in the table below. A Pro Rating Factor is expected to be applied to the Euro Notes and a non-
binding indication is detailed in the table below. The below indications are based upon the Reference
Yields and FX Rate as of at or around 10:00 a.m., New York time, on 16 September 2020; since the
Offer Cap is based upon the total amount paid to purchase Notes pursuant to the Offers, Holders should
note that the amount of each Series and each Pro-Rating Factor will be subject to, amongst other things,
the actual Reference Yields and FX Rate as of the Pricing Time. As such, the below values should be
treated as indications only.

                                                                          Aggregate principal      Indicative and

                         BHP Group Plc – Economic Contribution Report 2020



 Introduction

 Our Economic Contribution Report (Report) for the year ended 30 June 2020 was released today.

 BHP has a long-standing commitment to transparency. We believe it enhances understanding, builds trust and
 holds us and others to account.

 We’ve disclosed details of our tax and royalty payments for more than 20 years and during that time we have
 continually updated and expanded our disclosures. As in prior years, this Report discloses our total direct
 economic contribution, including the taxes and royalties we paid on a country-by-country and project-by-project
 basis. We disclose reconciliation of this data to our Financial Statements, including comparative data from prior
 years. We also disclose additional voluntary information, such as details of each of our subsidiary entities in ‘tax
 haven’ countries and tax incentives we have been granted in the countries in which we operateby some of our
 host governments. In addition, we disclose our intra- group transactions and relationships with tax authorities in
 compliance with the Australian Voluntary Tax Transparency Code. We also disclose further information regarding
 our approach to tax risk management and governance.

 The Report complies with a number of different tax transparency regimes. The information on our payments to
 governments is set out in accordance with the UK Regulations, which implement the EU Accounting Directive. By
 issuing the Report, we comply with the Australian Voluntary Tax Transparency Code. Beyond these requirements,
 we voluntarily disclose additional information, including our direct economic contribution, profit/(loss), number of
 employees and contractors and effective tax rates in the key countries in which we operate. Also, we support the
 voluntary disclosure of country-by-country reports that contain quantitative data, such as revenue from related
 and unrelated parties, profit/(loss) before tax, and number of employees for each country in which a subsidiary
 entity of a corporate group is tax resident. We will be publishing our country-by-country data for FY2019,
 separately to this Report.
Our Economic Contribution Report 2020 has today been submitted to the FCA National Storage Mechanism
and will shortly be available for inspection at https://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism. It is also
available to be downloaded on the BHP website at:

https://www.bhp.com/investor-centre/-/media/documents/investors/annual-
reports/2020/bhpeconomiccontributionreport2020.pdf

BHP’s corporate purpose is to bring people and resources together to build a better world. We are proud of the
valuable contribution we make to the communities where we operate and to society as a whole. The economic
contribution we make is an important part of this. Our total direct economic contribution for FY2020 was US$37.2
billion. This includes payments to suppliers, wages and benefits for our more than 80,000 employees and
contractors, dividends, taxes and royalties and voluntary investment in social projects across the communities
where we operate.

In FY2020, our tax, royalty and other payments to governments totalled US$9.1 billion. Of this, 82.2 per cent or
US$7.5 billion was paid in Australia. During the last decade, we paid US$85.0 billion globally in taxes, royalties
and other payments, including US$64.2 billion (approximately A$76 billion) in Australia.

Below are extracted sections of our full Economic Contribution Report 2020 that together meet the UK
Regulations.

Basis of report preparation

The Report is prepared from data recorded in our financial systems, being the same data and financial systems
used to prepare our Financial Statements. In preparing the Report, we have followed the draft guidance material
produced by the Australian Accounting Standards Board.

The ‘Total payments as defined by the UK Regulations’ included in pages 18 to 23 have been prepared in
accordance with the Reports on Payments to Governments Regulations 2014, as amended by the Reports on
Payments to Governments (Amendment) Regulations 2015 and the UK Regulations implement the EU
Accounting Directive (Chapter 10, Directive 2013/34/EU) (the ‘UK Regulations’).

Taxes, royalties and other payments to governments are presented in this Report on a cash paid and cash
received basis for the year ended 30 June 2020.

For our controlled assets, amounts included in our total payments to governments are 100 per cent of the assets’
payments to governments. For our non-operated and operated joint ventures, amounts included in our payments
to governments are 100 per cent of the amounts paid by BHP and, in the case of BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA),
50 per cent of payments made by the operating entity for BMA in which BHP has a 50 per cent ownership. For
our investments in joint ventures and associates that are equity accounted by BHP, no amounts have been
included in our total payments to governments as BHP is not the operator and does not make payments on behalf
of the operation. For information purposes, 100 per cent of the payments made by our significant equity accounted
investments have been shown on page 4 even though no amounts have been included in our total payments to
governments.

Taxes, royalties and other payments, both cash and in-kind (non-cash), to governments, net of refunds, are
collectively referred to in this Report as ‘total payments to governments’ and include the following payment
categories:

Corporate income taxes

Payments to governments based on taxable profits under legislated income tax rules. This also includes payments
made to revenue authorities in respect of disputed claims and withholding taxes. For the purposes of allocating
corporate income taxes to particular countries in the Payments made by country and level of government section
of this Report, withholding taxes are allocated to the country to which the withholding taxes are remitted – for
example, Chilean withholding taxes paid to the Chilean Government are allocated to Chile.

Royalty-related income taxes

Payments to governments in relation to profits from the extraction of natural resources, including Petroleum
Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) in Australia and Specific Tax on Mining Activities (STMA) in Chile. This also includes
payments to revenue authorities in respect of disputed claims. Royalty-related income taxes are presented as
income tax in section 5.1.1 Consolidated Income Statement in the Annual Report 2020.

Taxes levied on production

Payments to governments in relation to crude excise, carbon tax and severance tax on the extraction of natural
resources. Taxes levied on production are presented as expenses, not income tax, in section 5.1.1 Consolidated
Income Statement in the Annual Report 2020.

Royalties

Payments to governments in relation to revenue or production generated under licence agreements. This also
includes payments to revenue authorities in respect of disputed claims. Royalties are presented as expenses, not
income tax, in section 5.1.1 Consolidated Income Statement in the Annual Report 2020. Royalty-related income
taxes are excluded from Royalties.

Production entitlements

Payments to governments entitled to a share of production under production sharing agreements. Production
entitlements are most often paid in-kind. In-kind payments are measured based on the market value of the
commodity on the date of delivery to the government.
Fees

Payments to governments in the form of fees typically levied on the initial or ongoing right to use a geographical
area for exploration, development and/or production. This includes licence fees, rental fees, entry fees and other
payments for licences and/or concessions.

Payments for infrastructure improvements

Payments to governments for the construction of public infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and port facilities.

Dividend payments

Payments to governments with ownership interests in specific assets; not payments to governments as holders
of ordinary shares in BHP. There were no dividend payments to governments for the year ended 30 June 2020.

Signature, discovery or production bonuses

Payments to governments upon signing an oil and gas lease, when discovering natural resources, and/or when
production has commenced.

Other payments

Payments to governments under other legislated tax rules, such as payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, excise duties,
property tax, land tax and black lung tax. These payments are not specifically required to be disclosed by the UK
Regulations.

Excluded amounts

The following are not included in total payments to governments:

Taxes collected

Tax payments made to governments on behalf of our employees.

Indirect taxes

Tax payments made to or received from governments in the nature of sales tax, value added tax and goods and
services tax.

Penalties and interest

Payments to governments resulting from the imposition of penalties, fees or interest.

Certain payments, whether made as a single payment or as a series of related payments below US$100,000
(being a lower amount than the £86,000 threshold set out in the UK Regulations).

Projects

Payments made on a project-by-project basis (refer to Payments made on a project-by-project basis section of
this Report) present payments by entity when not specifically attributable to a project.

Payments in relation to Corporate Head Office and the Commercial function have been included in the total
payments to governments as defined by the UK Regulations. The payments are not attributable to specific
projects. ‘Corporate Head Office’ and ‘Commercial’ comprise functional support for the Group that in FY2020
consists entirely of projects that undertake relevant activities as defined by the UK Regulations.

The Payments made on a project-by-project basis section presents corporate income tax amounts for each
project/entity taking into account the effects of tax consolidation in Australia. These include the following:

• losses from one entity can be offset against taxable income of another entity within the same tax consolidated
group
• only the head entity of a tax consolidated group is liable to make corporate income tax payments to the Australian
Tax Office (ATO)

• typically, corporate tax groups allocate the aggregate corporate income tax payments made by the head entity
to the ATO among entities within the Australian tax consolidated group

Reporting currency

All payments to governments on pages 18 to 23 have been reported in US dollars. Payments denominated in
currencies other than US dollars are translated for this Report at the exchange rate at the date of the payment.



Glossary

Adjusted effective tax rate

Total taxation expense excluding exceptional items and exchange movements included in taxation expense
divided by Profit before taxation and exceptional items.

Adjusted effective tax and royalty rate

Total taxation expense excluding exceptional items and exchange movements included in taxation expense
plus royalty expense divided by Profit before taxation, royalties and exceptional items.

BHP or the Group

BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc and their respective subsidiaries.

Current tax expense

The amount of corporate income tax and royalty-related income tax and production entitlements currently
payable and attributable to the year, measured at rates enacted or substantively enacted at year-end, together
with any adjustment to those taxes payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax expense

The amount of corporate income tax and royalty-related income tax and production entitlements attributable to
the current year but payable in future years provided using the balance sheet liability method.

Employees and contractors

The weighted average number of employees and contractors across the Group is calculated from the actual
number of employees on the last day of the month over the 10-month period from July 2019 to April 2020 at
each BHP controlled site. It includes the Executive Director, 100 per cent of employees of subsidiary companies
and our share of proportionate consolidated entities. Employees of equity accounted entities are not included.
Part-time employees are included on a full-time equivalent basis. Employees of businesses acquired or
disposed of during the year are included for the period of ownership.

Government

Any national, regional or local authority of a country (includes a department, agency or undertaking that is a
subsidiary undertaking where the authority is the parent undertaking).

Income tax expense

The total of current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
Low-tax jurisdictions
In classifying which countries are ‘low-tax jurisdictions’, we have applied the EU list of non-cooperative
jurisdictions for tax purposes, issued in December 2017 by the European Union and subsequently updated. The
updated list used in this Report was issued on 28 February 2020.

Payments to shareholders, lenders and investors

Geographical distribution is based on the registered address of shareholders (for returns to shareholders
including dividends) and country of incorporation of the borrower for interest payments.

Profit before taxation


Profit before taxation when presented by country is adjusted for intercompany dividends.

Project

Consistent with the UK Regulations, a project is defined as the operational activities that are governed by a single
contract, licence, lease, concession or similar legal agreements and form the basis for payment liabilities with a
government. If multiple such agreements are ‘substantially interconnected’ they may be considered a project. For
these purposes ‘substantially interconnected’ means forming a set of operationally and geographically integrated
contracts, licences, leases or concessions or related agreements with substantially similar terms that are signed
with a government, giving rise to payment liabilities.

Report

The Report has been prepared for BHP’s financial year from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020.

Social investment

Includes community contributions and associated administrative costs (including costs borne by BHP to
facilitate the operation of the BHP Foundation), and BHP’s equity share in community contributions for both
operated and non-operated joint ventures.

UK Regulations
The Reports on Payments to Governments Regulations 2014, as amended by the Reports on Payments to

1. Principal risks and uncertainties
1.1 Risk management
The identification and management of risks is central to achieving our strategic
objectives. It protects us against potential negative impacts, enables us to take risk for
strategic reward and improves our resilience against emerging risks. BHP believes
effective risk management requires a single, consolidated view of risks across the
business to understand the Group’s full risk exposure and to prioritise risk
management and governance activity. As such, we apply a single framework (known
as the Risk Framework) for all risks.

There are four pillars in our Risk Framework: risk strategy, risk governance, risk
process and risk intelligence.


Risk strategy
Group Risk Architecture

The Group Risk Architecture is a tool to identify, analyse, monitor and report risk, which
provides a platform to understand and manage the risks to which BHP is exposed. It
currently comprises 12 Group Risk Categories, which cover a number of Group Risks.
Risks in BHP’s risk profile are connected to a Group Risk. This gives the Board and
management visibility over the aggregate exposure to risks on an enterprise-wide
basis and supports performance monitoring and reporting against BHP’s risk appetite.

For example, under the Group Risk of occupational safety, we have identified risks
relating to the safety of our people in performing their work (such as vehicle incidents,
falls from height and dropped objects) and, under the Group Risk of mental and
physical health, we have identified risks to our people associated with the impacts of
the COVID-19 pandemic on our assets and offices.

The Group Risk Architecture (as at 30 June 2020) is outlined in the diagram below.
The left column shows the Group Risk Category and the columns to the right show the
allocation of the Group Risks to each Category. This Group Risk Architecture changes
over time to reflect our strategy, changing activities, organisational accountabilities
and consideration of the external context. For example, Group Risks may be added,
removed, renamed, merged or moved between Group Risk Categories if there is a
more appropriate place for them in our continuously evolving Group Risk Architecture.

In FY2020, we added two new Group Risk Categories – Planning and technical, and
Allocation of capital and group planning – which include new Group Risks, as well as
Group Risks moved from other categories. The new Group Risks were created to
provide additional visibility and oversight of some of the Group’s most significant risks
and better recognise the importance of managing certain strategic risks, including
those relating to business planning, cash prioritisation and cash flow forecasts. In
addition, changes were made to existing Group Risks to further clarify and streamline
the Group Risk Architecture. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not required any
changes to be made to the Group Risk Architecture, which is sufficiently broad to
accommodate risks associated with the pandemic.

    Principal risks
    The allocation of our principal risks to the Group Risk Architecture is shown in a darker

    These include risks that could result in events or circumstances that might threaten
    our business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and reputation.

    In identifying our principal risks, we have considered the potential impact and
    probability of the related events or circumstances, and the timescale over which they
    may occur.

    Risk appetite
    BHP’s Risk Appetite Statement has been approved by the Board and is a foundational
    element of our Risk Framework. It is made up of a qualitative statement for each Group
Risk Category that describes the nature and extent of risk we are prepared to take in
pursuing our objectives. When a new Group Risk Category is introduced, the Board is
asked to approve an updated Risk Appetite Statement that includes a new qualitative
statement for that new Category. The Risk Appetite Statement provides guidance to
management on the amount and type of risk that is acceptable, and key risk indicators
are set by management to help monitor performance against our risk appetite.


Key risk indicators
Key risk indicators (KRIs) assist in identifying whether BHP is operating within or
outside of our risk appetite, as defined in our Risk Appetite Statement. They also
support decision-making by providing management with information about financial
and non-financial risk exposure at a Group level. KRIs are defined for Group Risks to
provide the data for proactive monitoring of BHP’s risk performance. Where upper or
lower KRI limits are exceeded, management will review potential causes to
understand if BHP may be taking too little or too much risk, and to identify whether
further action is required. Our current KRIs monitor data such as market concentration
based on the percentage of revenue linked to a single jurisdiction, the number of
critical cybersecurity incidents, greenhouse gas emissions relative to the FY2017
baseline and trends in the number of community complaints received.


Strategic business decisions
Strategic business decisions and the pursuit of our strategic objectives can inform,
create or affect risks to which BHP is exposed. These risks may represent
opportunities as well as threats. The Risk Appetite Statement and KRIs are available
to assist in determining whether a proposed course of action is within BHP’s risk
appetite.

Our focus when managing risks associated with strategic business decisions is to
enable the pursuit of high-reward strategies. Therefore, as well as having controls to
protect BHP from the downside risk, we will implement controls to increase the
likelihood of the opportunity being realised. For example, we might establish additional
governance, oversight or reporting to ensure new initiatives remain on track.


Risk governance
Risk management accountability and oversight is an integral part of BHP’s
governance. The Board and senior management (including the Executive Leadership
Team) provide oversight and monitoring of risk management outcomes. They are
ultimately responsible for ensuring BHP maintains a robust Risk Framework and an
effective internal control environment.

BHP uses the ‘three lines of defence’ model of risk governance and management to
define the relationships and clarify the role of different teams across the organisation
in managing risk. This approach is illustrated in the diagram below and integrates risk
management, control definition, control improvement, governance and assurance
frameworks into one governance model.

For example, for a loss of containment risk within the Group Risk of process
safety/hazardous materials containment, our first line operations personnel would be
responsible for implementing pipe thickness checks to ensure corrosion is within
acceptable limits. Second line functions, such as our engineering teams, would define
and assure minimum standards for pipe materials and acceptable levels of corrosion.
Our Internal Audit and Advisory team audits the effectiveness of the standards and
their application as the third line of defence.
BHP Board and committees
The Board reviews and considers BHP’s risk profile, covering operational, strategic
and emerging risks, based on the material risk report. The report includes an overview
of the risk profile, summary of material changes to the profile, performance against
KRIs, summaries of our priority Group Risks and, with the introduction of our
enterprise-level watch list in FY2020 (as described in the Emerging risk section),
updates on emerging risk themes. The contents of this report are further described in
the diagram in the Risk intelligence section.

The broad range of skills, experience and knowledge of the Board assists in providing
a diverse view on risk management. The Risk and Audit Committee (RAC) and
Sustainability Committee assist the Board with the oversight of risk management. For
more information, refer to sections 2.7, 2.10 and 2.11.

The Risk Appetite Statement is the mechanism by which the Board sets boundaries
for taking risk. It enables management to make risk-informed decisions within the risk
appetite that has been determined by the Board. Performance against risk appetite is
monitored and reported to the RAC and the Board, as well as the Sustainability
Committee for HSEC matters. This includes reporting of performance that is outside
upper or lower limits to indicate whether management is taking sufficient or excessive
risk, enabling the Board to hold management to account where necessary.

In FY2019, we introduced an additional second line led review of the Group’s most
significant risks (such as tailings storage facility failure) to provide greater oversight
and assurance of, and identify any opportunities to improve, the management of these
risks. This process, referred to as the Priority Group Risk Review process, reviews the
analysis and controls for risks that could impact the Group’s viability or strategy, with
findings and recommendations reported to the RAC and Sustainability Committee.
Findings and recommendations are considered by management and the Board and
may inform strategic decisions on whether to accept, reduce or eliminate risks to align
with the Group’s risk appetite, and may be used to develop remediation plans, such
as to improve risk analysis or control definition.

Additional information on risk management and internal controls is shared between
the Board, the RAC and, for HSEC matters, the Sustainability Committee and also
provided by the Business Risk and Audit Committees (covering each business region),
management committees, our Internal Audit and Advisory team and our External
Auditor. For more information, refer to section 2. Our approach to risk reporting is
outlined in the Risk intelligence section.
Risk process
Our Risk Framework requires identification and management of risks to be embedded
in business activities through the following process:
   -   risk identification – new and emerging risks are identified and each is
       assigned an owner, or accountable individual, in the part of our business
       where the risk is located.
   -   risk assessments – risks are assessed using an appropriate and
       internationally-recognised technique to determine their potential impacts and
       likelihood, prioritise them and inform risk treatment options.
   -   risk treatment – controls are implemented to prevent, reduce or mitigate
       downside risks and increase the likelihood of opportunities being realised.
   -   monitoring and review – risks and controls are reviewed periodically and on
       an ad hoc basis (including where there are high potential events or changes
       in the external environment, such as the COVID-19 pandemic) to evaluate
       performance.
Our Risk Framework includes requirements and guidance on the tools and process to
manage all risk types (current and emerging).
Current risks
Current risks may have their origin inside BHP or originate as a result of BHP’s
activities. These may be strategic or operational in nature and include material and
non-material risks.

The materiality of a current risk is determined by estimating the maximum foreseeable
loss (MFL) if that risk was to materialise. The MFL is not an estimate of the probable
impact to BHP if the risk was to materialise. Instead, the MFL is the estimated impact
to BHP in a worst case scenario without regard to probability and assuming that all
risk controls, including insurance and hedging contracts, are ineffective. For example,
when calculating the number of fatalities to assess MFL in the event of an offshore
well blow out, we assume the personnel capacity of the drilling rig even though there
may be fewer people on it at the time of an incident and despite controls such as
emergency response plans and equipment in place that are designed to reduce the
number of fatalities.

Our focus for current risks is to prevent their occurrence or minimise their impact
should they occur, but we also consider how to maximise possible benefits that might
be associated with strategic risks (as described in the Risk strategy section). Current
material risks are required to be evaluated once a year at a minimum to determine
whether our exposure to the risk is within our risk appetite.
Emerging risks
Emerging risks are newly developing or changing risks that are highly uncertain and
difficult to quantify. They are generally driven by external influences and often cannot
be prevented, although they can be prepared for. They also tend to be interconnected
and often require solutions that draw upon expertise from across our organisation.

In FY2020, we introduced an enterprise-level watch list of emerging themes that
provides an evolving view of the changing external environment and how it might have
an impact on our business. These themes represent areas of risk where a shift in
direction could have a significant impact on our operating environment, with the
potential to affect our strategy or business continuity.

We maintain the watch list and use it to support the identification and management of
emerging risks through our normal business activities and planning processes under
our Risk Framework, as well as to inform and test our corporate strategy.

Once identified, our focus for emerging risks is on structured monitoring of the external
environment, advocacy efforts to reduce the likelihood of the downside risks
manifesting and, where appropriate, considering emerging risks (including
opportunities) as part of our planning and strategy setting and review process. We
also apply contingency controls, such as response plans, to reduce the impact should
emerging risks that are outside our appetite occur. These controls increase the
resilience of BHP to shocks from the external environment. Emerging risks are
required to be evaluated once a year at a minimum to determine whether the risks
remain emerging and if our exposure is within our risk appetite.

Risk intelligence
The Board and senior management are provided with insights on trends and
aggregate exposure for our most significant risks, as well as performance against risk
appetite, by the Risk team. The Board also receives reports from other teams to
support its robust assessment of BHP’s emerging and principal risks, including internal
audit reports, ethics and compliance reports and the Chief Executive Officer’s report.

A summary of the risk reports delivered by the Risk team and how these provide
additional intelligence to the Board is outlined below.

Robust risk assessment and viability statement
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of BHP’s emerging and principal
risks, including those that could result in events or circumstances that might threaten
BHP’s business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and reputation.
The Board has assessed the prospects of BHP over the next three years, taking into
account our current position and principal risks.
The Board believes a three-year viability assessment period is appropriate for the
following reasons. BHP has a two-year budget, a five-year plan and a longer-term
life of asset outlook. As highlighted in the Risk factors section, there is currently
increased uncertainty in the external environment, including due to heightened
political and policy uncertainty, growing civil unrest in some countries in which we
operate and market volatility and geopolitical tensions resulting from the COVID-19
pandemic. This may increase the risk of commodity price and exchange rate volatility
and also affect the longer-term supply, demand and price of our commodities. These
factors result in variability in plans and budgets. A three-year period strikes an
appropriate balance between long- and short-term influences on performance.
The viability assessment took into account, among other things:
                                              - the reserve life of BHP’s
    - BHP’s commodity price
                                                  minerals assets and the
        protocols, including low-case
                                                  reserves-to-production life of our
        prices
                                                  oil and gas assets
    - the latest funding and liquidity
                                              - the Group-level risk profile and
        update
                                                  the mitigating actions available
    - the long-dated maturity profile of
                                                  should particular risks
        BHP’s debt and the maximum
                                                  materialise
        debt maturing in any one year
                                              - any actual and further
    - the flexibility in BHP’s capital
                                                  anticipated impacts of the
        and exploration expenditure
                                                  COVID-19 pandemic on BHP’s
        programs under the CAF
                                                  two-year budget and five-year
                                                  plan

The Board’s assessment also took into account additional stress testing of the
balance sheet against a number of scenarios that model three hypothetical events
occurring individually and together in various combinations over the 3-year viability
period. These hypothetical events were:
   1. an offshore well blow out involving a drilling rig that we operate
   2. simultaneous, short-term production outages at some of our most significant
      assets
   3. a low commodity price environment in FY2021 and FY2022, followed by a
      gradual recovery by FY2025
A number of our principal risks may have impacts that are embedded in these
scenarios. For example, operational risks associated with occupational and process
safety, asset integrity, tailings storage facilities and third party performance may
have comparable impacts to an offshore well blow out. Similarly, risks associated
with community, human rights and climate change (such as civil unrest or a natural
disaster, including the physical impacts of climate change or a pandemic) may result
in production outages at one or more of our assets, while risks associated with
commodity prices, geopolitics and stakeholder relations may have impacts that result
in a sustained low commodity price environment (for example, an economic
slowdown may be caused by geopolitical events or responses of governments and
other stakeholders to a pandemic). For further information on our principal risks, see
the Risk factors section.
Stress testing demonstrated that the Group’s balance sheet was put under the
greatest stress by the least likely scenario that all three hypothetical events occur
together. In such circumstances, the Board considered that the Group would have a
number of mitigating actions available to it, including deferral of discretionary capital
expenditure, issuance of debt and divestment of certain assets. A further level of
robustness is added given BHP would also have access to US$5.5 billion of credit
through its revolving credit facility.
The Board was also mindful of key risk indicator performance, regular balance sheet
stress testing against low commodity prices, and the assessment of our portfolio
against scenarios as part of BHP’s strategy and corporate planning processes to
help identify key uncertainties facing the global natural resources sector (including in
relation to climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic and commodity price volatility).
In making this viability statement, the Board has also made certain assumptions
regarding management of the portfolio, the alignment of production, capital
expenditure and operating expenditure with five-year plan forecasts and the
alignment of prices with the cyclical low price case used in monthly balance sheet
stress testing.
Taking account of these matters (including the assumptions) and our current position
and principal risks, the Board has a reasonable expectation that BHP will be able to
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years.

Risk factors
This section highlights our principal risks, as illustrated in the Group Risk Architecture
diagram in the Risk strategy section. Our principal risks have changed since FY2019,
largely due to changes in our external environment and the continued evolution of our
Group Risk Architecture. These changes can be summarised as follows.

Risks associated with tailings storage facilities, geotechnical stability, non-process fire
and explosion, and sales security and concentration have been identified as principal
risks to provide additional visibility of some of the Group’s most significant risks and to
better recognise the importance of managing certain strategic risks. Tailings storage
facilities risks are discussed in this section with asset integrity. Geotechnical failures
and underground fires or explosions may pose significant threats to the health and
safety of our people and are therefore discussed with occupational and process safety.
Strategic risks associated with gaining and maintaining access to the global markets
that we rely upon to trade our commodities are discussed with geopolitics and
stakeholder relations.

The scope of two of our principal risks was expanded in FY2020 and they have been
removed from the Group Risk Architecture diagram. Returns sustainability risks are
now captured by assets and growth options, which better supports and reinforces
revisions made to our purpose and strategy in FY2020. Risks associated with
geopolitics and macroeconomics now fall within geopolitics and stakeholder relations
in order to focus on broader macroeconomic and geopolitical trends that may affect
BHP and our stakeholders. The names of some of our principal risks have also
changed in order to better represent associated risks, although their scope remains
the same.

Our principal risks are further described in the risk factors listed on the following pages.
Each of these could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
performance, financial condition, prospects or reputation, leading to a loss of long-
term shareholder and/or investor confidence. While these represent our most
significant risks, BHP is also exposed to other risks that are important to us (for
example, health, safety, environmental, community, financial, reputational, legal or
other risks) that are not described in the risk factors.
We have considered the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business,
including through event tree analysis to assess its potential medium- to longer-term
cascading impacts on the Group’s risk profile and our enterprise-level watch list of
emerging themes. We will continue to assess the implications of the pandemic and
have referenced impacts to our principal risks in the following risk factors, where
relevant. To the extent that our business is adversely impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, any such impacts may also have the effect of heightening some of the risks
listed on the following pages.
Asset integrity and tailings storage facilities
Risks associated with operational integrity, tailings storage facilities and
performance of our assets.

Why is this important to BHP?
Maintaining the operational integrity and performance of our assets is crucial to protect
our people, the environment and communities in which we operate. We have onshore
and offshore assets in a variety of geographic locations, all of which exist in and
around broader communities and environments. A tailings dam failure, other serious
incidents (for example, structural failure of onshore or offshore production
infrastructure or a vessel incident through our supply chain, including groundings,
collisions and hydrocarbon release) or the failure to appropriately maintain or develop
our assets could have an impact on our people, surrounding communities and
environments, as well as our reputation, cash flow, operations or the longevity of our
assets.
While we seek to design and implement the right strategy and processes to maintain
the operational integrity and performance of our assets, we may not always be
effective in doing so. The impacts of any serious incidents that occur may also be
amplified if we fail to respond in an appropriate manner.

Threats
Failure to maintain the operational integrity and performance of our assets may reduce
their value and could lead to or exacerbate operational incidents, such as structural
failure of production infrastructure, dam failure or a vessel incident. Such failures
and/or operational incidents could result in:
     - multiple injuries and fatalities
     - extensive community disruption, including impacts to personal safety, livelihood
        and quality of life
     - short- and long-term health and safety risks to our people or the community (for
        example, exposure to diesel particulate matter, silica or coal mine dust from our
        mining operations may result in acute and/or chronic illness, such as coal mine
        dust lung disease)
     - environmental damage (for example, as a result of a dam failure releasing
        tailings, a hydrocarbon release or a vessel incident through our supply chain
        that affects air quality, biodiversity, water resources or environmentally sensitive
        areas)
     - loss of licences, permits or necessary approvals to operate assets
     - other adverse impacts on the communities in which we operate, including loss
        of community infrastructure and services, such as power, water or transport,
        and damage to cultural heritage sites
     - failure or redundancy of mining, processing or support infrastructure or
        equipment, such as a structural collapse or failure of a conveyor, petroleum
        platform or rail line
     - disruption to essential supplies or delivery of our products (for example, where
        channel blockage is caused by an owned, chartered or third party vessel
        incident, including at Port Hedland in Australia where our operations rely on a
        channel used by vessels unrelated to BHP)
    -   significant repair, recovery or reparation costs
    -   interruption in production or other critical activities and loss of revenue from
        operations that are directly or indirectly affected by an incident (for example, a
        loss of power supply or wider shutdown of operations pending safety reviews)
    -   litigation (including class actions), fines or investigations by authorities, and
        reputational damage
    -   loss of workforce confidence
    -   impacts on our ability to access capital (for example, an operational incident
        may affect our ability to retain the confidence of shareholders and other
        stakeholders, including financial institutions)
A failure to maintain the operational integrity and performance of our assets may
adversely impact asset value, including due to production shortfalls, loss of
development options or a delay in asset development (for example, structural failure
of critical ship loading infrastructure, such as at our iron ore operations in Port
Hedland, could result in a production shortfall). Such failures may also negatively
impact cash flows and profitability, result in financial write downs (for example, due to
a need to abandon remaining reserves where it is uneconomic to reconstruct or
recover the asset following a major incident) or increased costs or other commercial
impacts.
We take steps to maintain the operational integrity and performance of our assets
through planning, design, construction, operation and closure. However, our projects
are complex and may be adversely impacted by factors out of our control, such as
natural disasters or national crises. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in controls
being implemented by BHP and third parties that may affect the performance of our
assets. For example, workplace entry and travel restrictions may result in the delay of
key personnel or external consultants accessing our sites to undertake inspections or
other activities, potentially resulting in unidentified asset integrity issues or production
shortfalls.
Our risk financing approach is, where appropriate, to self-insure for certain risks,
including property damage and business interruption, sabotage and terrorism, marine
cargo reinsurance, construction, public liability and applicable employee benefits, or
to not purchase external insurance for certain risks. Business continuity plans may not
provide protection for all costs that arise from such events. Where external insurance
is purchased, third party claims may exceed the limit of liability of policies or our
insurers may become insolvent or otherwise unable to make payments under our
policies. Any uninsured or underinsured losses could impact our financial position or
the financial results of our assets.

Management
We employ a number of measures designed to protect the operational integrity and
performance of our assets, and to detect, eliminate, prevent and mitigate operational
incidents and outages. These measures include:
    - BHP’s standards on health, safety, the environment, communities, water and
       tailings storage facilities, maintenance, security, crisis and emergency
       management, and event and investigation management
    - planning, designing, constructing, maintaining and monitoring mines, dams
       and equipment to avoid incidents
    - maintaining and improving production infrastructure and equipment to protect
       our people and assets (for example, controls to maintain the structural
       integrity of dams)
    -   inspections and reviews (for example, independent dam safety reviews to
        assess the management of significant tailings storage facilities, both active
        and inactive as described in section 1.7.10)
    -   routine reviews of and revisions to management plans and manuals (for
        example, to test and update for alignment with operating specifications and
        industry dam codes)
    -   defining key accountable roles, and providing training and qualifications for
        staff and contractors
    -   maintaining local availability of critical skilled personnel within BHP, where
        possible, to increase operational resilience by ensuring the continuity of
        critical inspections and other activities (for example, this has mitigated the
        impacts of workplace entry and travel restrictions imposed on our assets in
        response to the COVID-19 pandemic)
    -   maintaining evacuation routes, supporting equipment, emergency
        preparedness and response plans, and business continuity plans
    -   collaborating with industry peers and relevant organisations on minimum
        standards (such as a minimum maritime standard for bulk ore carriers) and
        improvement of third party risk management practices to reduce exposure to
        external events, as well as identifying opportunities to improve our own risk
        management practices
For more information on our approach to risks associated with tailings storage facilities,
see section 1.7.10.

FY2020 insights
The Group’s exposure to asset integrity and tailings storage facilities risks is expected
to remain relatively stable. While the COVID-19 pandemic has not had significant
impacts during FY2020 on asset integrity and tailings storage facilities risks,
management of risk at each of our operated onshore and offshore assets will continue
to be reviewed to ensure we maintain an effective control environment for the duration
of the COVID-19 pandemic and safely transition to post-COVID-19 operating
conditions when it is appropriate to do so.

Occupational and process safety (including geotechnical failures and
underground fires or explosions)
Risks associated with the safety of BHP employees and contractors in
performing their work and the containment of hazardous materials.

Why is this important to BHP?
Our sites, offices and other places where our people are located in connection with
the performance of their work may be subject to occupational safety and process
safety/hazardous materials containment incidents. These may include fires and
explosions (above and underground), road, vehicle, mobile equipment, port, shipping,
railroad, aircraft or airport incidents (including where these services are contracted to
third parties), falls from height, lifting or crane incidents, food or water safety incidents,
loss of power supply, environmental pollution, geotechnical hazards, mechanical
equipment failures, mine-related accidents, personal conveyance equipment failures
or loss of primary containment of hazardous materials. Our oil and gas operations may
also experience a loss of well control involving an uncontrolled flow of well fluids or
formation fluids from the wellbore to the surface, including at our offshore operated
and non-operated assets. Our people may come into contact with electricity, work in
confined spaces, be exposed to conditions where air quality is unsafe, or work with or
in close proximity to hazardous materials, such as flammable, explosive, toxic,
corrosive or molten materials or other materials at high pressure or temperature, which
may lead to or exacerbate operational accidents. Exposure to some substances, such
as diesel particulate matter, may also pose short- and long-term health and safety
risks to our people. In addition, the mental and physical health of our people may be
affected by events that take place in connection with the performance of their work,
including threats to their physical security, workplace sexual harassment and assault
or other events or circumstances, such as controls implemented in response to a
pandemic.
We have onshore and offshore extractive, processing and logistical operations in
many geographic locations. Transporting our people to the locations of our exploration
activities and operations often involves helicopters, aeroplanes or other high
occupancy vehicles. We have port facilities and four underground mines, including
underground coal and nickel mines, and the nature of the activities performed at these
facilities and mines can involve safety hazards, such as geotechnical failures,
underground fires and/or underground explosions.
We operate in zones prone to natural disasters. This includes our Western Australia
Iron Ore, Queensland Coal and Gulf of Mexico oil and gas assets, which are located
in areas subject to cyclones or hurricanes, and our Chilean copper and Peruvian base
metals assets and Global Asset Services office in Manila, which are located in known
tectonically seismic (earthquake- and tsunami-prone) zones.

Threats
Occupational safety and process safety/hazardous materials containment incidents
(such as a geotechnical failure, an underground fire or explosion in one of our mines
or a well blow out during operated or non-operated drilling activities) may lead to
serious injuries, loss of life or livelihood or quality of life to BHP employees, contractors
or members of the community. In addition, these incidents may result in:
    - interruption to production or other activities critical to our business
    - disruptions to our supply chain
    - failure of processing equipment or support infrastructure (for example, relating
       to power, water, transport or technology)
    - environmental damage (for example, due to the uncontrolled release of
       hydrocarbons following an offshore well blow out)
    - increased costs or other commercial impacts
    - litigation (including class actions), fines or investigations by authorities and
       reputational damage
    - loss of workforce confidence
    - short- and long-term health and safety risks to members of the community, and
       adverse impacts on local communities’ economic position or human rights
Our response to occupational safety and process safety/hazardous materials
containment incidents, such as our emergency response or engagement with affected
stakeholders, may not be adequate and could result in impacts being amplified.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges for health and safety systems across
our operations, such as the implementation of social distancing measures at our sites.
A failure to adequately respond to these challenges could affect our ability to operate
in specific jurisdictions and may result in health and safety impacts, legal action or
reputational impacts. In addition, the pandemic may amplify impacts associated with
the occupational safety and process safety/hazardous materials containment risks
described above. For example, the ability of emergency services to respond to
operational incidents at our sites (including those described above) may be affected
by diversion of resources by local or national governments or additional safeguards
that have been implemented to protect emergency responders.
Our risk financing approach is to self-insure or not purchase external insurance for
certain risks. For more information, refer to the Asset integrity and tailings storage
facilities risk factor.

Management
We employ a number of measures designed to detect, eliminate, prevent and mitigate
occupational safety and process safety/hazardous materials containment incidents,
including:
    - BHP’s standards on aviation, health, safety, the environment and community,
        crisis and emergency management
    - compliance with quality assurance standards (for example, the Drilling and
        Completions Quality Assurance Standard for Petroleum offshore drilling and
        completion activity)
    - selection and design of mine plans (in compliance with our global geotechnical
        standards), wells and equipment to prevent incidents (including slope design
        and underground support systems)
    - inspection, maintenance and improvements of infrastructure and critical
        equipment to protect our people and assets (for example, cyclone resilience,
        pressure vessels designed to contain fluids or gas at pressure and emergency
        response equipment)
    - implementing controls at our operated assets to comply with applicable local
        laws and regulations on safety (for example, relating to the safe storage,
        handling and use of explosives, fuels and other flammable substances)
    - training and qualifications for staff and contractors (including drill rig contractors
        and aircraft operators)
    - specifying minimum technical specifications for aircraft
    - influencing joint venture partners to align with internationally recognised
        standards
    - monitoring adverse weather conditions, ground stability (based on early alert
        systems) and pressure/temperature of materials
    - continuity plans and crisis and emergency response plans
    - self-insurance for losses arising from property damage, business interruption
        and construction
    - applying our experience in safety frameworks to the issue of sexual harassment
        and assault in order to prevent and respond appropriately to such events, and
        create an inclusive workplace
    - implementation of a global COVID-19 control framework across BHP, which
        includes health and hygiene controls for our workforce, partners and the
        communities in which we operate

FY2020 insights
The Group’s occupational safety performance continued to improve in FY2020
compared to FY2019, with higher hazard identification and lower high potential
injuries, and the identification of process safety/hazardous material containment
incidents across our business also improved over this period. Exposure to these risks
is expected to remain relatively stable in FY2021. Our response to the COVID-19
pandemic is intended to support the safety of our workforce and maintain the
confidence of key stakeholders (such as local and national governments and the
communities in which we operate), and to enable the continuation of BHP’s operations
in a safe and sustainable manner. Notwithstanding our efforts and the efforts of local
and national governments where we operate, it is possible that the COVID-19
pandemic may continue to impact the communities where our assets are located,
which may jeopardise the health, safety and wellbeing of our workforce.
Geopolitics and stakeholder relations (including access to markets)
Risks associated with geopolitical changes and government actions that affect
the macroeconomic outlook, commodity demand and supply and/or impact our
ability to access resources, markets and the operational or other inputs needed
to realise our strategy; as well as relationships with key stakeholders whose
support is needed to realise our strategy and purpose.

Why is this important to BHP?
Geopolitical developments and changes in our relationships with key stakeholders
(such as investors, governments, employees, customers and suppliers) have the
potential to cause a wide range of impacts in locations where we operate or may wish
to operate, or where our customers and suppliers are located. In addition, we may be
affected by changes to bilateral relationships, the frameworks and global norms that
govern international trade, and other geopolitical developments (such as multilateral
agreements on climate change and freedom of navigation). This includes acute
shocks (such as civil unrest or sanctions) and chronic stresses (such as political or
business disputes and other forms of conflict, including military conflict) that may pose
longer-term threats to our business.
Disruptions or unanticipated changes of the nature described above may affect our
ability to sell our commodities for optimum value or access inputs required for the
effective pursuit of our strategy, including access to markets, resources, technology,
talent and capital. For example, our mining operations in Australia rely on equipment,
consumables (such as tyres) and specialised fabricated parts for ongoing operations,
expansion and development. We need to maintain access to international markets to
source these items. Changes in the external environment (such as increased
protectionism, changes in stakeholder expectations regarding our role in society, or
requirements to reduce emissions) may also impact our ability to realise our strategy
as competition for resources grows, existing reserves are depleted and supply sources
become increasingly expensive to develop.

Threats
Unilateral action by, or changes in relations between, countries in which we operate,
may consider operating or where our customers or suppliers operate, and such
countries’ approach to multilateralism, trade protectionism and political uncertainty,
can impact our ability to access resources, markets, technology, talent and capital,
shape the external environment, and adversely affect our financial performance. For
instance:
    - the challenging global political and economic conditions arising from the impact
       of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the relative damage to national
       economies and the speed at which they recover from the effects of the
       pandemic, may exacerbate existing tensions between countries and introduce
       a high degree of uncertainty in domestic and international policy settings.
       These conditions, as well as protectionism, interventionist industrial policy and
       restrictive trade policies (such as tariffs, sanctions or other measures that
       amount to import restrictions on our products), may adversely affect our ability
       to trade and impact demand for our products, as well as impact our access to
       resources, markets, technology, talent and capital
    - our ability to obtain and retain licences to explore or develop resources or
       access markets for sales or supply may be inhibited if there are tensions
       between a country where we operate or sell our products and other countries
       with which we are connected. Such tensions may result in trade remedies
       (such as punitive tariffs or quotas on inputs or outputs), rescission of licences,
       nationalisation of assets or limitations on markets or customer access that
       could affect our financial performance and reputation
   -   our operations may be disrupted or our access to customers and suppliers and
       their facilities may be restricted through disruptions to shipping lanes, ports,
       land logistics or other facilities as a result of civil unrest, conflicts, embargoes
       or other measures
   -   geopolitical events, such as a shift in the relationship between the United States
       and China or Australia and China, may affect the supply, demand and price of
       our commodities and therefore our financial performance. Shifts in great power
       relations may also introduce greater uncertainty with respect to issues requiring
       global co-ordination (such as climate change, trade agreements, tax regulation,
       freedom of navigation and technology regulation), as well as raise questions on
       the efficacy of and trust in international institutions, including those that
       underpin international trade. These types of changes may cause restrictions or
       impose costs on our business, and may inhibit our future opportunities
   -   evolving government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic may create
       challenges for us. For example, government responses to the pandemic have
       varied significantly across the globe and have resulted in and may continue to
       result in restrictions on our operations, including mandatory lockdowns or self-
       imposed temporary suspensions at our mines to allow effective systems to be
       implemented to meet government requirements, such as the temporary
       suspension of operations at Cerrejón in the June 2020 quarter. There may also
       be impacts on associated activities and the broader supply chain (such as
       measures affecting suppliers, essential services and transport of goods and our
       commodities) that could affect production or our financial performance
A failure to meet the expectations of or maintain strong relationships with key
stakeholders (including investors, governments, employees, suppliers and customers)
whose support is needed to realise our strategy and purpose could negatively affect
our business. Such failures could damage our reputation, our social value proposition
and/or negatively affect our ability to operate our assets and sell our products, which
may adversely impact financial performance. For example, not meeting growing
societal expectations of corporations to deliver value to all stakeholders can damage
our reputation and impact our ability to operate in jurisdictions where we have a
presence or to enter new jurisdictions. Growing societal and government expectations,
including in relation to climate change, and their effect on our business may also be
influenced by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (for example, if corporations
such as BHP are expected to play a larger role in the recovery of local and national
economies than we anticipate or if governments adjust climate change policy to take
into account economic recovery).

Management
The diversification of our portfolio of commodities, markets, geographies and
currencies is a key strategy intended to reduce our exposure to geopolitical and
macroeconomic shifts.
We actively monitor geopolitical and macroeconomic developments and trends,
including through our enterprise-level watch list of emerging themes that provides an
evolving view of the changing external environment (see Emerging risk section for
further information). We also regularly assess our ability to access markets, resources,
technology, talent and capital, as well as monitor the ongoing political and economic
landscape required to maintain trade and access for the effective pursuit of our
strategy. This enables an understanding of potential impacts on our business and the
identification of mitigating actions.
In addition, we monitor the sociopolitical environment in which we operate and the
stakeholders that influence that environment in order to prioritise and manage the
threats and opportunities that could have the greatest impacts on our business and
our social value proposition. We also engage regularly and seek to maintain strong
relationships with governments and other key stakeholders to understand, respond to
and manage any potential impacts from changes to policy that could affect us, such
as trade or resource policies, or evolving expectations of BHP.

FY2020 insights
Our FY2019 Annual Report anticipated that the Group’s exposure to risks associated
with geopolitics and macroeconomics would increase in the short-term due to
heightened political and policy uncertainty. This trend has accelerated due to changes
in relationships and increased strategic competition at an international level (for
example, between the United States and China, and Australia and China), a decline
in multilateralism, growing civil unrest in some countries in which we operate (as
further described in the Community and human rights risk factor), and market volatility
and geopolitical tensions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our influence over
most of these aspects of our external environment is limited and the Group’s exposure
to the risks described above may continue to increase in the short-term.
On stakeholder relations, we anticipate risks associated with changing expectations
of stakeholders related to the role of corporations in society are likely to increase in
the short-term, as governments and societies continue to deal with the COVID-19
pandemic and begin to realise the adjustments required for the recovery of national
economies.

Capital allocation, and assets and growth options
Risks associated with the allocation of capital through annual planning and
other processes, to make investment decisions and to discover, maintain and
grow assets suited to our capabilities and strategy.

Why is this important to BHP?
Our strategy is to have the best capabilities, commodities and assets to create long-
term value and high returns. While we seek to design and implement the right strategy
at the right time, we may not always be effective in doing so.
Our decisions and actions relating to the allocation of capital across asset or reserve
discovery, acquisition, maintenance, growth, development or divestment, impact our
financial performance and financial condition, and therefore the sustainability of our
returns. This is particularly the case with commodities that we view as attractive (for
example, copper, oil and nickel sulphides).

Threats
Changes in our portfolio, failure to secure or discover new reserves or resources,
missed opportunities to invest or a failure to effectively allocate capital or achieve
expected returns from existing assets or growth investments have impacted our
performance in the past and may in the future lead to:
    - loss of value, for example, due to incorrect or changing assumptions (including
       those related to commodity prices) used to assess growth or investment
       opportunities
    - failure to achieve expected commercial objectives from assets or investments,
       including cost savings, sales revenues or operational performance, resulting in
       value loss (such as that experienced with US shale)
    - poor performance of current assets due to over-investment in growth capital at
       the expense of non-discretionary sustaining capital (for example, delaying asset
       maintenance tasks to free up capital for growth projects resulting in production
       losses)
   -   unexpected costs or liabilities of an investment due to poor regulatory
       conditions in a new region, inherited liabilities of acquired assets or entities
       (such as legacy asset rehabilitation or legal dispute costs)
   -   adverse market reactions (for example, to businesses associated with
       production or use of energy coal) resulting in a potential impact to our
       reputation, social value or our ability to retain the confidence of external
       stakeholders and shareholders to execute our strategy
   -   poor performance impacting our ability to deliver forecasted returns to
       shareholders
   -   not investing in opportunities due to increased debt levels resulting in a lack of
       available growth capital
   -   missed investment opportunities due to a failure to understand potential new
       developments or identify major trends (for example, faster electrical vehicle
       penetration or hydrogen cost competitiveness could impact whether we are well
       positioned for these changes in copper, nickel, metallurgical coal or petroleum)
   -   financial write-downs (for example, as a result of changes in market, industry or
       prices, inability to recover reserves, deteriorating demand/supply fundamentals,
       value migrating away from where we are positioned in value chains, per our
       strategy as described in section 1.4.1, or additional costs)
   -   loss of overall value at an asset due to the pursuit of the incorrect strategy (for
       example, investing in growth projects in a commodity that may have
       deteriorating demand fundamentals, such as energy coal)
   -   lack of diversified production base, increasing exposure to large single-event
       risks (for example, too much reliance on Australian-based assets or particular
       commodities) that may result in loss of value or reduced cash flows
   -   inability to retain or attract key staff who are critical to the successful design and
       implementation of our strategy, including in relation to the allocation of capital
       and growth in our business
As evidenced by price volatility during CY2020, there are and may continue to be
potential short to medium-term impacts on certain commodity prices due to the
COVID-19 pandemic that could impact values and result in growth project delays.

Management
We have a number of strategies, processes and frameworks in place designed to grow
and protect the strength of our portfolio and to help deliver ongoing returns to
shareholders, including:
   - our exploration program, with a focus on replenishing our resource base and
      enhancing our portfolio
   - a long-term strategy that informs the decisions and actions in capital allocation
      and which is embedded through a tested CAF
   - an ongoing strategy process that assesses the competitive advantage of our
      business and enables identification of threats and opportunities for our portfolio
      using forecasting and fit-for-purpose scenarios
   - monitoring indicators to interpret external events and trends
   - commodity strategies and commodity price protocols that are reviewed and
      presented to the Executive Leadership Team and Board
   - corporate planning processes, including life-of-asset plans, capital prioritisation
      and asset appraisals, which inform forecasts for proposed investments and
      operations
   - management reviews and governance activities to support operational and
      project forecasts and planning
   -   our CAF, which provides the structure and governance for prioritising capital
       allocation across the Group and adding growth options to our portfolio (for more
       information, refer to section 1.4.5)
   -   investment approval processes that apply to investment decisions, including
       mergers and acquisitions activity, overseen by an investment committee as
       described in sections 2.14 and 2.15
   -   annual reviews of our portfolio valuations to identify any value change and test
       internal value methodologies and assumptions against external benchmarks
   -   embedding the social value framework designed to drive better outcomes that
       benefit all stakeholders through strategy, planning and investment processes
       (including emissions, water, other environmental factors and community
       initiatives)

FY2020 insights
While the COVID-19 pandemic has affected commodity prices and had significant
impacts on businesses and national economies around the world (as discussed in the
Geopolitics and stakeholder relations risk factor), it may also present opportunities for
growth options through acquisitions in attractive commodities that align with our
strategy. The discipline and competition for capital stimulated through our CAF is
designed to drive better decision-making and capital efficiency. This helps to strike a
balance between returns to shareholders and reinvesting in the business and is
intended to enable us to be in a position to consider acquisition opportunities that may
arise.

Commodity prices
Risks associated with the prices of commodities, including sustained price
shifts relative to the price of extraction.

Why is this important to BHP?
The prices we obtain for our minerals, oil and gas are determined by or linked to prices
in world markets, which have historically been and may continue to be subject to
significant volatility.

Threats
Fluctuations in commodity prices can occur in response to a range of factors. These
include price shifts triggered by global economic and geopolitical factors, industry
demand, increased supply due to the development of new productive resources or
increased production from existing resources, technological change, product
substitution and national tariffs. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted
and may continue to have an impact on commodity price volatility due to rapid demand
deterioration from affected customers/countries, supply disruption from key producing
regions or logistical constraints impacting supply chains, which may therefore affect
our financial performance.
We are particularly exposed to price movements in minerals, oil and gas. For example,
a US$1 per tonne decline in the average iron ore price and US$1 per barrel decline in
the average oil price would have an estimated impact on FY2020 profit after taxation
of US$163 million and US$24 million, respectively. For more information on commodity
price impacts, refer to section 1.5.2. Commodity prices can also be affected by
exchange rate fluctuation, which impacts our financial results.
Long-term price volatility or sustained low prices may adversely affect our future
profitability. This could result in cost pressure, as we do not generally have the ability
to offset costs through price increases. In addition, this impact may result in lower than
desired credit ratings for BHP, restricting our access to debt funding or increasing our
financing costs.

Management
Our usual policy is to sell our products at the prevailing market prices. We manage our
exposures primarily through the diversity of commodities, markets, geographies and
currencies provided by our relatively broad portfolio of commodities. However, this
does not necessarily insulate us from the effects of price changes.
Note 22 ‘Financial risk management’ in section 5 outlines our financial risk
management strategy, including market, commodity and currency risk.
FY2020 insights
Impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and other geopolitical and macroeconomic
developments (mentioned in the Geopolitics and stakeholder relations risk factor) are
expected to increase commodity price volatility. Volatility in the market will continue to
translate into profit variability.

Community and human rights
Risks that have the potential to impact human rights and/or communities and
affect support for our business with stakeholders, including communities,
governments or the general public.

Why is this important to BHP?
We recognise that our everyday interactions, activities, behaviours and decisions are
intricately linked to the long-term viability of our business and to the social and
economic wellbeing of the communities where we have a presence.
Impacts could be in relation to our environmental, community, legal and regulatory
performance (such as human rights, community wellbeing, water and biodiversity,
climate change, Indigenous peoples and local, regional and national economies), and
also the effect of shareholder or civil society activism on our business. Changes in
society and the evolving expectations of communities and our other stakeholders have
the potential to change and increase these impacts.
Although our community and environmental performance is intended to go beyond
managing threats to actively contributing to the resilience, rehabilitation and
conservation of the natural environment and communities with which we work, we may
not always be successful in doing so if our social value proposition is inadequate or
we are unable to implement it.

Threats
BHP may engage in activities that have or are perceived to have adverse impacts on
communities, society, cultural heritage, human rights and the environment. These
activities, such as exploration, production, construction or expansion of our operations,
vary depending on the social, economic and environmental context of each of our
operations and may take place on or adjacent to Indigenous peoples’ territories or
areas of importance for biodiversity or cultural conservation.
These activities, or a failure to effectively engage with communities and relevant
stakeholders, can affect our relationships with or be viewed negatively by the
community and other stakeholders and may result in adverse impacts on human rights
(for example, disruption of community access to water, including through
contamination of potable water supplies). In addition, they could result in the following
impacts to our business:
   -   loss of rights to explore, operate or expand our current asset base, delays in
       approvals, increased costs or reduced production for new or existing projects
   -   withdrawal of consent or support from Indigenous peoples
   -   opposition to our projects or our entry into new jurisdictions, including through
       legal or social action
   -   increased costs for mitigation, offsets or financial compensatory actions or
       obligations
   -   loss of customer base or restriction of the countries to which we can supply
       products
   -   loss or limited access to commercial partners or employee talent
   -   increased taxes, royalties and other governmental or administrative charges
   -   reduced access to equity and capital markets
   -   civil unrest, industrial relations disputes or action, negotiations, litigation or
       regulatory action, resulting in higher costs and a loss of productivity
   -   reputational damage
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected community health, safety and quality of life,
and had economic impacts on livelihoods and supply chains, particularly to regional
communities and Indigenous peoples. All of these impacts and our response to them
may amplify existing risks and have the potential to affect our business. This may
include production interruptions, delays or refusals of regulatory approvals and
reputational damage (for example, an outbreak of COVID-19 in a community that is or
is perceived to be caused by BHP may result in criticism from our stakeholders,
including investors).
Heightened societal expectations can also result in changes to legal requirements, as
well as litigation, inquiries, regulatory action or government responses against BHP.
For example, the transportation of our commodities by third parties or procurement of
materials needed for our mining operations, such as personal protective equipment,
tyres or conveyor belts, may be connected to a breach of legislation intended to
prevent modern slavery or a breach of human rights within our supply chain by a direct
or indirect supplier.

Management
In FY2020, social value was integrated into asset plans, which is intended to enhance
our contribution to the natural environment, communities and our many stakeholders
at an asset and Group-wide level.
BHP’s standards for communications, community and external engagement, and
supply chain management provide mandatory minimum requirements and practices
that are designed to strengthen our social and human rights performance. In addition,
our Human Rights Policy Statement, Climate Change Position Statement, Water
Stewardship Position Statement and Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement set out our
commitments to human rights, climate change, water security and access to safe
water for all, and the traditional rights of Indigenous peoples (including our approach
to engaging with Indigenous peoples).
These requirements and our practices also include:
   - conducting regular impact assessments for each operated asset to understand
       the social, environmental, human rights and economic context
   - identifying and analysing stakeholder, community and human rights impacts,
       including modern slavery risks
   - engaging in regular, open and honest dialogue with stakeholders to understand
       their expectations, concerns and interests
   - contributing to environmental and community resilience through social
       investment
   -   completing due diligence on all current and new suppliers through our Ethical
       Supply Chain processes
These activities also assist us to identify, mitigate or manage key potential social,
environmental and human rights risks, as described in section 1.7.

FY2020 insights
The Group’s exposure to risks associated with the community and human rights is
expected to increase as societal, community and political pressures continue to grow,
as evidenced by recent civil unrest in Chile, the United States and other countries
where we have a presence. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified risks and impacts
associated with pre-existing factors that affect communities and society across some
of our locations (such as inadequate community services and community health and
safety). This highlights the need for a rapid and coordinated response by BHP in
partnership with relevant stakeholders and, along with adjustments required for the
recovery of local and national economies, may present an opportunity for BHP as
strong social performance could generate competitive advantage in Australia and
other countries in which we operate. For information on our community response to
the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to section 1.4.6.

Climate change
Risks associated with changes in climate patterns, as well as risks arising from
policy, regulatory, legal, technological, market or other societal responses to the
challenges posed by climate change.

Why is this important to BHP?
We are exposed to a broad range of climate-related risks arising from the physical and
non-physical impacts of climate change. Climate-related risks may affect our
operations, the markets in which we sell our products, the communities in which we
operate and our upstream and downstream value chains.
Risks related to the potential physical impacts of climate change include acute risks
resulting from increased severity of extreme weather events and chronic risks resulting
from longer-term changes in climate patterns.
Risks related to the non-physical impacts of climate change, or transition risks, arise
from a variety of policy, regulatory, legal, technological, market and other societal
responses to the challenges posed by climate change and the transition to a low
carbon economy. The production and use of fossil fuels receive scrutiny from a range
of stakeholders, including governments, investors, NGOs and communities. This is
because the combustion of fossil fuels is a significant source of greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions. We produce fossil fuels (energy coal, oil and gas) used primarily in
the transport and electricity generation sectors, as well as fossil fuels and other
commodities that are used as inputs to emissions-intensive industrial processes
(including metallurgical coal and iron ore used in steelmaking). We also use fossil fuels
in our mining and processing operations either directly or through the purchase of
fossil fuel-based electricity. We therefore have already been and may be further
impacted by policies and regulations that reduce GHG emissions, including from the
resources, electricity generation, transport and industrial sectors. Technological and
market-related risks include the substitution of existing technologies with lower
emissions options, such as renewables, particularly in the electricity generation and
transport sectors, which have the potential to reduce demand for fossil fuels.

Threats
Risks associated with climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy
could affect the execution of our strategy, the expansion of our portfolio and the ability
of our operated and non-operated assets to operate efficiently.
We are exposed to risks related to the physical impacts of climate change (for
example, potential changes in precipitation patterns, water shortages, rising sea
levels, increased storm intensities, higher temperatures and natural disasters). These
risks may affect us directly, such as by causing damage to our assets, or indirectly,
such as through value chain disruptions (or a combination of both). Risks related to
the physical impacts of climate change may materially and adversely affect our
business, including through:
    - adverse impacts to the health and safety of our people
    - adverse impacts to our assets, such as failures of mining or processing
         equipment, loss of containment, mining infrastructure failures (for example,
         power, water, rail and port) and support infrastructure failures (for example,
         technology services and office buildings). Such adverse impacts may affect
         our business, including through reduced productivity, increased costs and
         project schedule delays
    - disruptions to our supply chains, transport and distribution networks,
         customers’ facilities and the markets in which we sell our products

In addition, assessments of the potential impact of future climate change policy,
regulatory, legal, technological, market, societal and environmental outcomes are
uncertain given the wide scope of influencing factors and the countries in which we do
business. For example, countries will need to introduce new or strengthen existing
policies and regulation in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Accordingly,
the following risks relating to the transition to a low carbon economy have (in some
instances) already affected us and may in the future continue to affect us:
    - the Group’s asset carrying values or financial performance may be affected by
        any adverse impacts to reserve estimates or market prices that may occur if,
        for example, reserves are rendered incapable of extraction or demand for fossil
        fuel commodities (such as petroleum and energy coal) decreases due to policy,
        regulatory (including carbon pricing mechanisms), legal, technological, market
        or other societal responses to climate change in our operating jurisdictions or
        markets
    - climate change may increase competition for and the regulation of limited
        resources, such as power and water, which are critical to the operation of our
        business. This could affect the productivity of and costs associated with our
        assets
    - we are impacted by current and emerging policy and regulation aimed at
        reducing GHG emissions from the resources, electricity generation, transport
        and industrial sectors, including the introduction of carbon pricing mechanisms.
        Climate policy and regulation, as well as changes to international reporting
        standards on climate change and pressure from society for more rapid and
        aggressive action from governments and companies, may reduce demand for
        our products, increase our costs and affect our business and stakeholders,
        including by reducing investor confidence
    - increased scrutiny of applications for licences, permits or authorisations
        required to develop our assets and projects, including third parties contesting
        such applications. This could delay, limit or prevent future development of our
        assets or affect the productivity of and costs associated with our assets
    - the Group’s reputation and financial performance may be impacted by
        concerns regarding the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change (for
        example, some financial institutions and other institutional investors have
        declared an intention to exit certain commodities that are seen to be associated
        with climate change, such as energy coal). Impacts could affect our share
        price, reduce investor confidence, constrain our ability to access capital from
        financial markets, or result in an inability or increase in cost to insure our assets

The following threats, which are common to risks related to both the physical impacts
of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy, may also materially and
adversely affect our business:
    - increased costs for mitigation, offsets or financial compensatory actions or
        obligations, including taxes and royalties
    - restricted access to capital or an inability to attract new or retain existing
        employees
    - adverse impacts to the environment, communities, human rights and social
        wellbeing, which could affect our relationships with and be viewed negatively
        by the community and other stakeholders and damage our reputation
    - opposition to new projects or our entry to new jurisdictions by communities,
        including through legal or social action, or other loss of business opportunities
    - the Group may be subject to, or impacted by, climate-related litigation
        (including class actions), associated costs and reputational damage
Management
We have a Climate Change Position Statement that sets out our views on climate
change and our commitments to act in response to climate change. The Our
Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standard establishes minimum
requirements for managing climate change threats and opportunities and supports the
execution of our climate change strategies and plans through our corporate planning
processes.
We work with globally recognised agencies to obtain regional analyses of climate
science to improve our understanding of the potential climate vulnerabilities of our
operations and communities where we operate, and to inform resilience planning at
an asset level. We take a risk-based approach to adaptation, including consideration
of the potential vulnerabilities of our operated assets, investments, portfolio,
communities, ecosystems and our suppliers and customers across the value chain.
Our operated assets are required to develop plans to build climate resilience into their
activities and we require proposed new investments to assess and manage risks
associated with potential physical impacts of climate change.
Climate-related scenarios, themes and signposts are used to evaluate the resilience
of our portfolio and inform BHP’s strategy. Climate-related risks are assessed
alongside the other threats and opportunities that BHP faces when making capital
expenditure decisions or allocating capital through our CAF. Our Risk Framework
helps identify these risks for input to the prioritisation of capital and to investment
approval processes. Our investment evaluation process has incorporated market and
sector-based carbon prices for more than a decade.
In CY2020, we published the BHP Climate Change Report 2020 that describes our
latest portfolio analysis, including a 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned scenario. We
continue to monitor climate-related developments that could impact the resilience of
our portfolio and remain alert to policy, regulatory, legal, technological, market, societal
and environmental developments that may indicate changes to our signposts and the
development of new uncertainties in our portfolio analysis.
We seek to mitigate our exposure to risk arising from current and emerging policy and
regulation in our operating jurisdictions and markets by reducing our operational
emissions. In CY2020, we set a medium-term target to reduce our operational GHG
emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 from our operated assets) by at least 30 per cent
from FY2020 levels(1) by FY2030. We also take a product stewardship approach to
emissions in our value chain. In CY2020, for example, we set public goals to address
Scope 3 emissions.
Identifying cost-effective and robust carbon offsets is important to meeting our
emissions reduction commitments and managing reputational risk. We therefore also
support the development of market mechanisms that reduce global GHG emissions
through projects that generate carbon credits.
We also respond to our exposure to policy and regulatory risk by advocating for the
development of an effective, long-term policy framework that can deliver a measured
transition to a low carbon economy.
The Group continues to monitor policy, market and technological changes and
community, investor and regulatory standards and expectations as they develop, to
inform appropriate management actions.
For more information on our climate change risk management strategy, refer to the
BHP Climate Change Report 2020 available at bhp.com/climate.


(1) FY2020 baseline will be adjusted for any material acquisitions and divestments based on greenhouse gas
emissions at the time of the transaction. Carbon offsets will be used as required.

FY2020 insights
During FY2020, community, investor and regulatory standards and expectations in
relation to climate change continued to increase. Public response to severe natural
disasters, including bushfires in Australia this year, heightened scrutiny of potential
links between climate change and physical impacts and spurred calls for more rapid
and aggressive action from governments and companies. In addition, the COVID-19
pandemic and the subsequent reduction in economic activity decreased emissions,
which may lead to opportunities to restart economies with a greater focus on
sustainability.

Cybersecurity
Cyber-related risk events, including attacks on our enterprise or incidents
relating to human error, online and web-based operations and infrastructure.

Why is this important to BHP?
Many of our business and operational processes are supported by and dependent on
technology. As automation and the speed of technological innovation continues to
increase, our dependence on technology is likely to grow. We are moving towards an
increased reliance on autonomous systems for haulage and drilling. Throughout our
operations, we have substantial integration between our information technology and
operating technology systems. All such systems may be subjected to cyber events or
attacks and these can have significant impacts, including on our business and
stakeholders.

Threats
Cyber events or attacks may lead to:
   - operational or commercial disruption (such as the inability to process or ship
       resources)
   - corruption or loss of system data
   - a misappropriation or loss of funds
   - unintended disclosure of commercial or personal information
   - health and safety incidents, including fatalities (where cyber events or attacks
       cause system error or malfunction, which result in operational incidents)
   -   environmental damage (for example, a cybersecurity breach of operational
       systems controlling pumps and valves resulting in material being released into
       the environment)
   -   a hampered ability to respond appropriately to unrelated incidents
   -   regulatory fines and compensation to people impacted
   -   loss of licences, permits or necessary approvals to operate assets
   -   reputational damage

Management
We employ a number of measures designed to protect against, detect and respond to
cyber events or attacks, including:
   - BHP’s standards on technology and cybersecurity, communications and
       external engagement
   - cybersecurity strategy and resilience programs
   - enterprise security framework and cybersecurity standards
   - cybersecurity awareness plan and training
   - security assessments and monitoring
   - restricted physical access to critical centres, servers and network equipment
   - incident response and crisis management plans

FY2020 insights
There were no identified cybersecurity breaches to the Group’s technology
environment during FY2020 despite an increase in attempted cyberattacks during the
COVID-19 pandemic. The Group’s exposure to cybersecurity-related risk events
increased in FY2020 and is expected to increase further, primarily due to our growing
reliance on technology and the increasing sophistication and frequency of external
cyberattacks.

Third party performance
Risks associated with non-operated joint ventures and the delivery of products
and services by third parties engaged by BHP, including contractors.

Why is this important to BHP?
The Group, through its affiliated entities, holds interests in companies and joint
ventures that we do not operate, primarily within Minerals Americas (Samarco,
Antamina, Resolution and Cerrejón) and Petroleum (Algeria, Australia and Gulf of
Mexico). Joint venture partners or other companies managing non-operated joint
ventures may take action contrary to our standards or fail to adopt or apply standards
equivalent to our standards in relation to health, safety, environment, communities and
other aspects of operations. In these situations, we may be unable to influence non-
operated joint venture activities and any incidents could result in potential financial,
legal and reputational exposure.
In addition, approximately 60 per cent of our workforce (around 40,000 people) are
contractors, with approximately 80 per cent of those contractors undertaking activities
classified as high risk. As a result, appropriate contractor selection and effective
management of contractors from a safety, business ethics, cost, quality, schedule and
performance perspective is important to the success of our business. We also contract
with many commercial and financial counterparties, including end customers,
suppliers, joint venture partners and financial institutions, which may experience
financial difficulties (for example, in the context of global financial markets that remain
volatile).

Threats
Third party (including contractor) activities, including a failure to adopt and apply
standards, controls and procedures that are equivalent to ours, could lead to material
risks, including the risk of:
    - safety events that may result in injuries or fatalities, including among community
         members
    - production downtime and damage to or loss of equipment or facilities
    - delay in project delivery
    - poor quality on service delivery
    - failure to meet remediation and compensation requirements (such as delays to
         community resettlements related to the Samarco dam failure; see section 1.8
         for information on our response, support and commitments)
    - litigation (including class actions) or regulatory action, inquiries and reputational
         damage
    - shareholder activism (for example, to divest our interest in a non-operated joint
         venture or stop using a certain supplier)
    - industrial action, civil unrest or other adverse impacts on human rights (for
         example, our joint venture partners may not engage in appropriate consultation
         with communities or non-operated joint venture operations may cause
         disruptions to community access to water, including through contamination of
         potable water supplies)
A failure by suppliers, contractors or joint venture partners to perform existing contracts
or obligations may lead to adverse impacts, including:
    - non-supply of key inputs, such as explosives, mining equipment, petrol and
        other consumables important to our business
    - loss of access to third party owned or supplied infrastructure
    - disruption to essential supplies or delivery of our products (for example, where
        access to or use of BHP owned and operated rail is disrupted by third parties)
    - reduction in production at our assets
    - litigation (for example, for contractual breach) and reputational damage
    - loss of revenue
The potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on third parties may increase the
likelihood of or amplify the risks or impacts set out above. For example, the operators
of our non-operated joint ventures may not implement effective standards, controls or
procedures in response to the pandemic, which may result in production downtime. In
addition, there is an increased likelihood of disruptions to our supply chains, which
may result in a shortage of critical equipment and supplies in some geographical
locations. The mobility of our direct and indirect workforce (including contractors) has
been limited by restrictions implemented due to the pandemic which, for example, may
impact the delivery of construction projects.
Our existing counterparty credit controls may not prevent a material loss to us due to
our credit exposure to certain customer segments, or commercial or financial
counterparties.
Our risk financing approach is to self-insure or not purchase external insurance for
certain risks. For more information, refer to the Asset integrity and tailings storage
facilities risk factor.

Management
We manage our interests in non-operated joint ventures through:
  - dedicated non-operated joint venture teams
  - development of formal influencing plans and key focus areas specific to each
     non-operated joint venture
  - governance frameworks that define how joint venture partners work together
     with operators
   -   where appropriate, governance improvement plans specific to non-operated
       joint ventures
   -   BHP and external reviews of non-operated joint venture projects, risk
       management and governance activities
   -   internal audits and participation in joint venture partner audits of non-operated
       joint ventures
In addition, we have global practices and standards for operations and production that
apply to contractors, including:
    - BHP’s standards on supply, safety, health, aviation and capital projects
   -   Our Code of Conduct, which sets out requirements related to working with
       integrity, including dealings with third parties as described in section 2.16
   -   our Contractor Management Framework, which specifies a holistic approach to
       support regional alignment and is supported by global training
   -   training on anti-corruption, competition and Our Code of Conduct
   -   independent inspections, assurance and verifications (in some cases
       performed by regulatory bodies)
We are in the process of improving our Contractor Management Framework by
developing a globally integrated approach, enabled through the introduction of a new
BHP standard for contractor management, delivery of a suite of technology solutions
to support the end-to-end contractor management process, building organisational
capacity and capability, and changing behaviours to be more inclusive and integrated
with our contractor workforce.
We maintain a ‘one book’ approach with commercial counterparties, which means we
aim to quantify and assess our credit exposures on a consistent basis. We also have
contingency plans in place if production or shipping is interrupted.

FY2020 insights
While the COVID-19 pandemic may affect some third party performance risks (as
described above), it has also presented opportunities to BHP. These include focusing
on local supply chain resilience by supporting small, local and Indigenous businesses
(for example, in March and April 2020 we made immediate payments of outstanding
invoices and reduced payment terms from 30 to seven days for our small, local and
Indigenous suppliers in Australia and for those that support our Petroleum business),
as well as employing additional contractors to support our Australian operations.

Legal, regulatory, ethics and compliance
Risks associated with legal, regulatory, ethics and compliance obligations.

Why is this important to BHP?
Our operated assets and non?operated joint ventures involve material long?term
investments that are dependent on long-term legal, regulatory, political, judicial and
fiscal stability. In addition, the nature of the industries in which we operate means many
of our activities are highly regulated, including through laws and regulations imposed
at the local, state and regional levels as well as the federal, national and international
levels in the jurisdictions in which we operate. This includes laws and regulations
relating to bribery and anti-corruption, trade and financial sanctions, market
manipulation, taxation, royalties, collusion, anti-competitive behaviour, anti-money
laundering, data protection and privacy, controls on production, trade, imports and
exports, prices on greenhouse gas emissions, native title and other land rights, sexual
harassment and assault, and health, safety and the environment. Our Code of
Conduct and our other internal policies, standards, systems and processes reflect
these requirements.
Section 1.8 details our response and support in relation to the Samarco dam failure
as well as progress on our commitments.

Threats
Certain action or inaction, whether intentional or unintentional, by BHP or its Directors,
executives, employees or third party partners (including non-operated joint ventures)
could result in actual or alleged breaches of laws or regulations relating to the matters
set out in this risk factor above or other legal, regulatory, ethical or compliance
obligations. Actions of this nature, or changes in laws or regulations due to the
developing nature of government regulations and international standards, could lead
to (among others) the following threats to our business, reputation and operations:
    - actions, investigations or inquiries by regulatory authorities or courts over actual
        or alleged legal or regulatory breaches (for example, over suspected facilitation
        payments or bribery and corruption which are prevalent in some of the countries
        where we do business or our assets are located)
    - disgorgement of profits (for example, if bribery or corruption is established)
    - civil proceedings against or criminal prosecution of Directors, executives,
        employees or third party partners
    - loss of operating licences, permits or approvals
    - operational impacts, such as unforeseen closures, site rehabilitation expenses,
        delays or disruption
    - increased compliance costs (for example, to meet new or more onerous
        operating or reporting standards)
    - regulatory fines or settlements (for example, from a failure to comply with
        reporting standards or recognise royalties)
    - increased costs in relation to taxation or royalties if laws or policies change
    - adverse change to regulatory regimes for access to government-owned or
        privately-operated infrastructure or resources (for example, rail, electricity or
        water), resulting in additional costs, onerous terms or limitations on access by
        BHP, which may adversely impact our financial performance or disrupt
        operations
    - renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts, leases, permits or other
        agreements, nationalisation of assets or other measures being taken against
        our business or people
    - litigation (including class actions), prosecutions or disputes (such as in
        connection with ownership and use of land) and the associated cost and
        disruption arising from such litigation, prosecutions or disputes
    - public inquiries such as Parliamentary inquiries or Royal Commissions, which
        may adversely impact our reputation and ability to pursue projects or conduct
        operations and which may lead to changes to laws with cost or other impacts
        to financial performance
    - loss, uncertainty or changing conditions associated with land tenure, including
        in countries where compliance with laws is a condition of the underlying land
        tenure or for the renewal of that tenure. For example, withdrawal of consent or
        support from Indigenous land rights holders (as discussed in the Community
        and human rights risk factor)
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased government action around the world.
Varying responses to the pandemic at all levels of government have amplified pre-
existing differences in policy and standards between and within countries and may
continue to do so. Increased government action has resulted in and may continue to
result in heightened legal obligations in relation to, for example, the provision of a safe
and healthy workplace, management of personal health-related data, and public
health and emergency management. In addition, community, investor and regulator
expectations as to corporate governance requirements for the Board to satisfy its
fiduciary duties in response to the pandemic have changed and may continue to
change. Any actual or perceived failures to comply with these heightened legal
obligations or changes to policies, standards or other requirements or expectations,
whether intentional or unintentional, could result in litigation or enforcement action,
fines or penalties and reputational damage (such as criticism from our stakeholders,
including investors).
We conduct our business globally in numerous jurisdictions with complex regulatory
frameworks. Our governance and compliance processes may not identify or prevent
misstatements or fraud or prevent potential breaches of law, accounting or governance
practice.
Management
We have internal policies, standards, systems and processes for governance and
compliance, including:
   - Our Code of Conduct
   - BHP’s standards on business conduct, market disclosure, and information
       governance and controlled documents
   - training on Our Code of Conduct and in relation to anti-corruption, market
       conduct and competition matters
   - contractor due diligence and automated risk screening
   - global monitoring of compliance controls and higher risk transactions by our
       Ethics and Compliance function
   - ring fencing protocols to separate potentially competitive businesses within
       BHP
   - classification of compliance sensitive transactions
   - governance and compliance processes (including the review of internal controls
       over financial reporting and specific internal controls in relation to trade and
       financial sanctions, market manipulation, competition, data protection and
       privacy, and corruption)
   - oversight and engagement with higher risk areas by our Ethics and Compliance
       function, Internal Audit and Advisory team and the Disclosure Committee
   - EthicsPoint anonymous reporting service, supported by an ethics and
       investigations framework and central investigations team (within the Ethics and
       Compliance function) to investigate Our Code of Conduct concerns. Material
       breaches of Our Code of Conduct are reported to the Board on a regular basis
       and individuals are encouraged to report anything they believe may be
       misconduct or an improper state of affairs or circumstance without fear of
       retaliation (EthicsPoint is discussed in further detail in section 2.15)

FY2020 insights
The Group’s exposure to risks associated with legal, regulatory, ethics and compliance
issues may increase given changes in the external environment. These risks could be
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as by the continuing response of
governments and society to ethical and cultural failings within large corporates,
including the financial services industry. Exposure to these risks may also increase in
the event of additional investment and activity in higher risk jurisdictions. The impacts
of the pandemic on such jurisdictions may amplify those risks (for example, adverse
effects on local economic wellbeing may increase corruption risks).

Balance sheet and liquidity
Risks associated with our ability to maintain a robust and effective balance
sheet, raise debt, return value to shareholders and remain financially liquid.

Why is this important to BHP?
Fluctuations in commodity prices, operational or supply chain disruptions and ongoing
global economic volatility could materially and adversely affect our future cash flows
and ability to access capital from financial markets at acceptable pricing. If our liquidity
and cash flows deteriorate significantly, it may adversely affect our ability to fund our
strategy.

Threats
If our key financial ratios and credit ratings are not maintained, our ability to fund
current and future capital projects and acquisitions, cost of financing, solvency and
our ability to return value to shareholders may be impacted.
A number of risks across the Group Risk Architecture, including our principal risks,
could adversely impact the Balance Sheet and liquidity to varying degrees should they
occur and depending on their severity. Examples of risks that may affect our short to
medium-term cash flow generation, profitability or the value of our assets (including
reserves) – and therefore the Balance Sheet and/or liquidity – include:
    -   a significant reduction in production at our assets caused by material third party
        performance issues and operational disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic
    -   long-term commodity price volatility and sustained low prices. For example, a
        prolonged low oil price may result in write downs to our petroleum reserves,
        and a sustained decrease in the price of iron ore may have significant impacts
        on liquidity (in FY2020, 48 per cent of our revenue was derived from iron ore),
        as discussed further in the Commodity prices risk factor
    -   inability to sell our commodities (for example, caused by physical blockages of
        shipping lanes, closure of ports or land logistics, or other restrictions to trade,
        including as a result of tensions between a country where we operate or sell
        our products and other countries with which BHP is connected, as discussed in
        the Geopolitics and stakeholder relations risk factor)
Management
The Financial Risk Management Committee (FRMC) oversees the financial risks
across our business and endorses or approves financial risk management strategies,
mandates and activities, including those related to commodity, currency, credit and
insurance markets. The role of the FRMC is described in sections 2.14 and 2.15. Note
22 ‘Financial risk management’ in section 5 outlines our financial risk management
strategy.
We seek to maintain a strong Balance Sheet supported by our portfolio risk
management strategy. To achieve this, we:
  - operate a diversified portfolio, which reduces overall cash flow volatility
  - maintain access to key debt markets globally and a US$5.5 billion revolving
     credit facility (undrawn as at 30 June 2020)
  - monitor target gearing levels and credit rating metrics under a range of different
     stress test scenarios incorporating operational and macroeconomic factors
  - assess cash flow at risk to monitor sensitivities to market prices and their impact
     on key financial ratios
    -    maintain target cash and liquidity buffers within ranges set by the Board (which
         are designed to sustain BHP through periods where there is limited access to
         debt markets)
    -    operate within credit limits set by frameworks approved by the FRMC

FY2020 insights
The global economy has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased
geopolitical uncertainty, including the impact on national economies and the speed at
which they recover from the effects of the pandemic, has further weighed on the
macroeconomic outlook. There is a risk of heightened fluctuations in commodity
prices, operational or supply chain disruptions and ongoing global economic volatility,
which could affect short to medium-term cash flow generation and profitability.

3. Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The following statement which was prepared for the purposes of the Annual Report
2020 is repeated here for the purposes of complying with DTR 6.3.5. It relates to and
is extracted from the Annual Report 2020 and is not connected to the extracted and
summarised information presented in this announcement.

“In accordance with a resolution of the Directors of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group
Plc, the Directors declare that:
(a) in the Directors’ opinion and to the best of their knowledge the Financial
    Statements and notes, set out in sections 5.1 and 5.2, are in accordance with

NEWS RELEASE

Release Time      IMMEDIATE
Date              10 September 2020
Release Number    12/20




BHP climate change briefing

BHP today provided an update on its progress on climate action, new climate
commitments, and how it integrates climate change into corporate strategy and
portfolio decisions.

BHP’s climate change approach focuses on reducing operational greenhouse
gas emissions, investing in low emissions technologies, promoting product
stewardship, managing climate-related risk and opportunity, and partnering
with others to enhance the global policy and market response.

BHP supports the aim of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well
below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit warming to
1.5°C.

BHP has been active in addressing climate risks for more than two decades,
and has already established its long-term goal of achieving net zero
operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 2050 and its short-term target of
maintaining operational emissions at or below adjusted FY2017 levels by
FY2022, using carbon offsets as required.

In the past year, BHP has made good progress. The Escondida and Spence
copper mines in Chile will move to 100 per cent renewable energy by the mid-
2020s, and last week BHP awarded a new renewable energy contract for its
Queensland Coal assets, and the world’s first LNG-fuelled Newcastlemax bulk
carrier tender.

BHP’s climate change briefing and 2020 climate change report, also published
today, outline how the company will accelerate its own actions and help others
to do the same. Today’s update sets out:

   -   A medium-term target to reduce operational greenhouse gas emissions
       by at least 30 per cent from adjusted FY2020 levels by FY2030, using
       carbon offsets as required.

   -   Scope 3 actions to contribute to decarbonisation in our value chain.

   -   Strengthened linking of executive remuneration to delivery of BHP’s
       climate plan.

   -   Insight into the performance of BHP’s portfolio in a transition to a 1.5°C
       scenario.

BHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry, said: “I’m pleased today to show
how we are accelerating our own actions and helping others to do the same in
addressing climate change. We see ourselves as accountable to take action.
We recognise that our investors, our people and the communities and nations
who host our operations or buy our products have increasing expectations of
us – and are responsive to these.

“Our approach to climate change is defined by a number of key requirements.
Our actions must be of substance. They must be real, tangible actions to drive
emissions down. We must focus on what we can control inside our business,
and work with others to help them reduce emissions from the things that they
control. To create long-term value and returns over generations, we must
continue to generate value and returns within the strong portfolio we have
today, while shaping our portfolio over time to benefit from the megatrends
playing out in the world including decarbonisation and electrification.

“Our portfolio is well positioned to support the transition to a lower carbon world
aligned with the Paris Agreement. It includes commodities that are essential for
global economic growth and the world’s ability to transition to, and thrive in, a
low carbon future. Climate change action makes good economic sense for
BHP and enables us to create further value.”

                                                                                                                                                   Memorandum.


                     (1)     The Early Consideration shall be calculated from the applicable Fixed Spread and includes the Early Tender Payment.
                             The Late Consideration (defined below) in respect of Notes of each relevant Series will be calculated by deducting the
                             Early Tender Payment from the Early Consideration (defined below). See the Tender Offer Memorandum for further
                             details.
                     (2)     For illustrative purposes only, a hypothetical Early Consideration for each Series is set out in the table above, based upon
                             a hypothetical Pricing Time as at 10.00 a.m. (New York time) on 1 September 2020, where the hypothetical US Dollar
                             Notes Reference Yield was 0.270 per cent. and the hypothetical Interpolated Euro Mid-Swap Rate was -0.400 per cent.,
                             and assuming an Early Settlement Date of 21 September 2020. Holders should note that the actual Early Consideration
                             for each Series determined in the manner described in the Tender Offer Memorandum could differ significantly from the
                             hypothetical Early Consideration for each Series set out in the table above.

The Offers will commence on 2 September 2020 and will expire, unless terminated earlier, at 11:59 p.m.
(New York time) on 30 September 2020 or at such other date or time to which the Offers may be
extended, reopened, amended and/or terminated as provided in the Tender Offer Memorandum (such
applicable date and time, the “Expiration Deadline”).

Holders that validly tender their Notes and do not validly withdraw their Notes, at or prior to 5:00 p.m.
(New York time) on 16 September 2020 as may be extended or otherwise amended by the Companies
(such applicable date and time, the “Early Tender Deadline”) will be eligible to receive the Early
Consideration (defined below), which includes the Early Tender Payment, plus Accrued Interest.
Holders that validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration
Deadline will only be eligible to receive the Late Consideration (defined below) plus Accrued Interest.
Notes tendered may be withdrawn at any time prior to or at 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on 16 September
2020, as may be extended or otherwise amended by the Companies (such applicable date and time,
the “Withdrawal Deadline”) but not thereafter (other than in the limited circumstances set out in the
Tender Offer Memorandum).


The relevant deadlines set by any intermediary or Clearing System will be earlier than these deadlines.
Except in the limited circumstances described in the Tender Offer Memorandum, Notes tendered prior
to the Withdrawal Deadline may be withdrawn any time prior to or at the Withdrawal Deadline but
following the Withdrawal Deadline, a Tender Instruction will be irrevocable. Tender Instructions must be
submitted in respect of a minimum principal amount of Notes of the relevant Series of no less than the
Minimum Denomination for such Series, and may be submitted in integral multiples of US$1,000 or
€1,000, as applicable.


The Offers are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, as set forth in the Tender Offer
Memorandum.


Offer Cap


If the Companies (or one of the Companies, as the case may be) decide to accept any Notes for
purchase pursuant to the Offers, they propose to accept for purchase pursuant to the relevant Offer(s)
an aggregate principal amount of Notes such that the total amount payable for all Notes accepted for
purchase pursuant to the relevant Offer(s) (excluding Accrued Interest) is no greater than the cash
amount equal to US$1,900,000,000 (with any euro amounts being converted into US dollars at the FX
Rate at the Pricing Time in accordance with the terms set out in the Tender Offer Memorandum),
although the Companies reserve the right (acting together), but are under no obligation, to increase or
decrease such amount in respect of the Offers at any time, subject to applicable law (the “Offer Cap”),
which, in the event of an increase, could result in the Companies purchasing a greater aggregate
principal amount of Notes in the Offers.


Priority of Acceptance and Pro-Ration


Subject to the Offer Cap and the pro-ration arrangements described in the next paragraph, the
aggregate principal amount of each Series that is purchased pursuant to the Offers will be determined
in accordance with the Acceptance Priority Levels, with Acceptance Priority Level 1 being the highest
and Acceptance Priority Level 2 being the lowest. All US Dollar Notes validly tendered pursuant to the
relevant Offer, having Acceptance Priority Level 1, will be accepted before any validly tendered Euro
Notes, having Acceptance Priority Level 2; however, if the Companies purchase Notes on the Early
Settlement Date, all Notes validly tendered prior to or at the Early Tender Deadline will have priority over
Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline, regardless of the Acceptance Priority Levels of such
later tendered Notes. Notes validly tendered and purchased on the same Settlement Date shall be
purchased in accordance with the Acceptance Priority Levels.
If the total amount payable (excluding Accrued Interest) for validly tendered Notes with the same
Acceptance Priority Level would (together with the total amount payable (excluding Accrued Interest)
for any validly tendered Notes with a higher Acceptance Priority Level, where applicable), if purchased,
exceed the Offer Cap, such Notes will be purchased on a pro-rata basis such that total amount payable
(excluding Accrued Interest) for all Notes validly tendered in the Offers and accepted for purchase does
not exceed the Offer Cap, as further described in the Tender Offer Memorandum. If the purchase of all
Notes validly tendered prior to or at the Early Tender Deadline would result in an aggregate amount
payable (excluding, for this purpose, Accrued Interest) that would equal or exceed the Offer Cap, then
no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline will be purchased pursuant to the Offers regardless
of the Acceptance Priority Level of such Notes, unless the Companies increase the Offer Cap (acting
together, in their sole discretion).


The Companies have an option to redeem remaining Notes of a Series at par plus any accrued
but unpaid interest following the purchase of 80 per cent. of such Series of Notes


The terms and conditions of each Series allow the relevant Company (subject to applicable laws) to
redeem the Notes in that Series early (in whole but not in part), at their outstanding principal amount
plus any accrued but unpaid interest, if a “Substantial Repurchase Event” occurs, meaning at least 80
per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such Series issued on the “Issue Date” for
such Series has been purchased by or on behalf of the relevant issuing Company and certain related
parties of the relevant issuing Company. Such redemption will be subject to giving not less than 30 days’
irrevocable notice.


It is the current intention of each Company to acquire the remaining Notes of any Series in accordance
with the Series’ terms and conditions if a “Substantial Repurchase Event” is triggered in respect of such
Series by the purchase of any Notes pursuant to the relevant Offer(s). However, no Company is under
any obligation to make any such acquisition and each Company’s intention to do so may change at any
time and for any reason. No assurance can be given that the 80 per cent. threshold described above
will or will not be met in respect of any Series of Notes.


Early Consideration, Late Consideration and Accrued Interest


The amount in cash to be paid by the relevant Company for each US$1,000 or €1,000 (as applicable)
in principal amount of each Series validly tendered pursuant to the relevant Offer prior to or at the Early
Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase by the relevant Company shall be an amount (rounded to
the nearest cent, with US$0.005 and €0.005 (as applicable) being rounded upwards) that would reflect,
as of the Early Settlement Date, a yield to the First Reset Date of such Series equal to the sum of: (i)
the Reference Yield for such Series, plus (ii) the Fixed Spread for such Series set out in the above table
(in respect of each Series, the “Early Consideration”). The Reference Yield will be determined at the
Pricing Time on the Pricing Date with reference to, as applicable, the Reference Security or Reference
Interpolated Rate, as shown in the above table.


Specifically, the Early Consideration for each Series will equal (i) the value of all remaining payments of
principal and interest on the relevant Series up to and including the applicable First Reset Date
(assuming all outstanding Notes of the relevant Series are redeemed at their principal amount on the
applicable First Reset Date) discounted to the Early Settlement Date at a discount rate equal to the sum
of (x) the applicable Reference Yield plus (y) the applicable Fixed Spread, minus (ii) Accrued Interest.
The Early Consideration for each Series, when calculated in the manner set out above, includes the
applicable Early Tender Payment listed in the above table.


The amount in cash to be paid by the relevant Company for each US$1,000 or €1,000 (as applicable)
in principal amount of each Series validly tendered pursuant to the relevant Offer after the Early Tender
Deadline but prior to or at the Expiration Deadline and accepted for purchase by the relevant Company
shall be an amount (rounded to the nearest cent, with US$0.005 and €0.005 (as applicable) being
rounded upwards) equal to the Early Consideration for the relevant Series minus an amount equal to
the applicable Early Tender Payment listed in the above table (in respect of each Series, the “Late
Consideration”).


The Companies shall also pay Accrued Interest on all Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase
pursuant to the relevant Offer(s).

NOTE: Additional information required by the JSE Listing Requirements

1.       The dividend should be regarded as a ‘foreign dividend’ for the purposes of South African
         income tax and South African dividends tax.

2.       Dividend Tax will be withheld from the amount of the gross final dividend of 185.26200 South
         African cents per ordinary share paid to shareholders on the South African branch register at
         the rate of 20 per cent, unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption.

3.       After the Dividend Tax has been withheld, the net dividend will be 741.04800 South African
         cents per ordinary share.

4.       BHP Group Plc had a total of 2,112,071,796 ordinary shares in issue at the dividend
         determination date of 18 August 2020.

5.       The dividend will be paid out of retained earnings.

6.       For the avoidance of doubt, Dividend Tax, and therefore the information provided in this
         announcement, is only of direct application to shareholders on the South African branch
         register.

7.       We have been advised that banks are ceasing to produce (and later accept) cheques in the
         interest of facilitating safer and quicker payment, and this now impacts the payment of the
         September 2020 dividend in South Africa. Therefore, BHP Group Plc will no longer be issuing
         dividend cheques in South Africa. All future payments will only be made into a nominated bank
         account by electronic funds transfer. Shareholders who have not yet provided their bank
         account details are reminded to contact Computershare Investor Services (Pty) Limited with
         their account details into which dividends can be paid electronically.

Shareholders on the South African branch register should direct any questions regarding the
application of the Dividend Tax to:

                                       Limited made in order to meet expected tax obligations arising

                                    * The five-year performance period for the 2015 Long Term
                                    Incentive Plan ended on 30 June 2020. Mike Henry’s 2015 Long
                                Term Incentive Plan award comprised 192,360 awards (awarded
                                prior to his appointment as CEO), subject to achievement of the
                                relative Total Shareholder Return performance conditions and a
                                holistic “look back” review of performance over the five-year
                                period by the Remuneration Committee. For the award to vest in
                                full, Total Shareholder Return must exceed a Peer Group Total
                                Shareholder Return (for 67 per cent of the award) and an Index
                                Total Shareholder Return (for 33 per cent of the award) by an
                                average of 5.5 per cent per year for five years, being 30.7 per cent
                                in total compounded over the performance period from 1 July
                                2015 to 30 June 2020. Total Shareholder Return includes returns
                                to BHP shareholders in the form of share price movements along
                                with dividends paid and reinvested in BHP (including cash and in-
                                specie dividends). BHP’s Total Shareholder Return performance
                                was positive 29.0 per cent over the five-year period from 1 July
                                2015 to 30 June 2020. This is above the weighted median Peer
                                Group Total Shareholder Return of positive 9.6 per cent and
                                below the Index Total Shareholder Return of positive 38.5 per
                                cent over the same period. This level of performance results in 48
                                per cent vesting for the 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan awards.
                                The Remuneration Committee reviewed performance holistically
                                over the five-year period, and determined that it was appropriate
                                to allow 48 per cent of the 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan awards
                                to vest.

                                  Long Term Incentive Plan award comprised 174,873 awards,
                                  subject to achievement of the relative Total Shareholder Return
                                  performance conditions and a holistic “look back” review of
                                  performance over the five-year period by the Remuneration
                                  Committee. For the award to vest in full, Total Shareholder
                                  Return must exceed a Peer Group Total Shareholder Return
                                  (for 67 per cent of the award) and an Index Total Shareholder
                                  Return (for 33 per cent of the award) by an average of 5.5 per
                                  cent per year for five years, being 30.7 per cent in total
                                  compounded over the performance period from 1 July 2015 to
                                  30 June 2020. Total Shareholder Return includes returns to
                                  BHP shareholders in the form of share price movements along
                                  with dividends paid and reinvested in BHP (including cash and
                                  in-specie dividends). BHP’s Total Shareholder Return
                                  performance was positive 29.0 per cent over the five-year
                                  period from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2020. This is above the
                                  weighted median Peer Group Total Shareholder Return of
                                  positive 9.6 per cent and below the Index Total Shareholder
                                  Return of positive 38.5 per cent over the same period. This level
                                  of performance results in 48 per cent vesting for the 2015 Long
                                  Term Incentive Plan awards. The Remuneration Committee
                                  reviewed performance holistically over the five-year period, and
                                  determined that it was appropriate to allow 48 per cent of the
                                  2015 Long Term Incentive Plan awards to vest.

NEWS RELEASE
Release Time     IMMEDIATE
Date             17 August 2020
Release Number   08/20



Resolutions under section 249N of the Corporations Act for consideration at
the AGM

In accordance with ASX Listing Rule 3.17A, the wording of three proposed
resolutions that have been requisitioned under section 249N of the Corporations Act
for consideration at the Annual General Meeting of BHP Group Limited, to be held
virtually on 14 October 2020, is set out in Attachment A.

The proposed resolutions have been requisitioned by shareholders of BHP Group
Limited representing approximately 0.01% of the shares on issue in BHP Group
Limited (and approximately 0.006% of the shares on issue in the combined BHP
Group).

The BHP Group Limited Notice of Annual General Meeting will be published in
September, and will include the requisitioned resolutions and the requisitioning
shareholders’ statements of support as well as the Board’s response and voting
recommendations. Consistent with the BHP Dual Listed Company framework, the
proposed resolutions will also be included on the BHP Group Plc Annual General
Meeting agenda.
ATTACHMENT A

Resolution 1

Special resolution to amend our company’s constitution

To amend the constitution to insert a new clause 46:

Member resolutions at general meeting

The shareholders in general meeting may by ordinary resolution express an opinion,
ask for information, or make a request, about the way in which a power of the
company partially or exclusively vested in the directors has been or should be
exercised. However, such a resolution must relate to an issue of material relevance
to the company or the company's business as identified by the company, and cannot
either advocate action which would violate any law or relate to any personal claim or
grievance. Such a resolution is advisory only and does not bind the directors or the
company.

Resolution 2

Ordinary resolution on cultural heritage protection

Recognising that legislative review processes are underway in relation to the extent
of Indigenous cultural heritage protections in Australia, in order to manage immediate
risks to cultural heritage and shareholder value, shareholders recommend that our
company take the following interim steps, until such time that relevant laws are
strengthened:

   a. adopt a moratorium on undertaking activities which would disturb, destroy or
      desecrate cultural heritage sites in Australia, to be reviewed annually by the
      Board;
   b. commit to non-enforcement of any relevant contractual or other provisions that
      limit the ability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Traditional Owners to
      speak publicly about cultural heritage concerns on their land; and
   c. disclose its expectations in relation to any lobbying on cultural heritage issues
      by any industry association of which it is a member.

Nothing in this resolution should be read as limiting the Board’s discretion to take
decisions in the best interests of our company.

Resolution 3

Ordinary resolution on lobbying relating to COVID-19 recovery

Shareholders request that the Board undertake, as soon as practicable, a review of
advocacy activities undertaken by our company’s Industry Associations relating to
economic stimulus measures in response to COVID-19.

Shareholders recommend that our company suspend, for a period deemed suitable
by the Board, membership of Industry Associations where the review demonstrates,
on balance, a record of advocacy inconsistent with the Paris Agreement’s goals.

Nothing in this resolution should be read as limiting the Board’s discretion to take
decisions in the best interests of our company.

                             BHP OPERATIONAL REVIEW
                        FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

Note: All guidance is subject to further potential impacts from COVID-19 during
the 2021 financial year.

.    The commitment of our workforce, our disciplined controls and financial
     strength has enabled us to continue to safely operate through the COVID-19
     pandemic and deliver a strong performance.

.    Met full year production guidance for iron ore,  metallurgical coal and
     our  operated copper and energy coal assets.  Petroleum  production
     marginally below guidance with lower than expected gas demand due to the
     impact of COVID-19 in the June 2020 quarter. Antamina and Cerrejon
     production  lower than  guidance  following  the  temporary  suspension
     of operations due to COVID-19, with both operations now ramping back up.

.    Record  production was achieved at Western  Australia Iron Ore (WAIO),
     Caval Ridge and Poitrel despite impacts from wet weather and COVID-19,
     while record coal was mined at Broadmeadow and record average concentrator
     throughput was delivered at Escondida.

.    Group copper  equivalent  production for the 2020 financial year broadly
     in line with the prior year, with volumes expected to be slightly lower in
     the  2021  financial  year  due to  impacts  from  a  reduction  in
     operational workforces in copper in response to COVID-19 and petroleum
     natural field decline.

.    We expect to achieve full year unit cost  guidance/(1)/ at WAIO,
     Queensland Coal and New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC). Petroleum and
     Escondida unit costs are expected to be slightly better than guidance
     (based on 2020 financial year guidance exchange rates of AUD/USD 0.70 and
     USD/CLP 683).

.    Our major  projects  under  development  in petroleum  and iron ore are
     tracking to plan. As a result of measures put in place to reduce the spread
     of COVID-19 in Chile, first production from the Spence Growth Option is now
     expected between December 2020 and March 2021. We continue to assess the
     impacts of COVID-19 and the temporary reduction in construction activity
     at Jansen.

.    As previously announced,  we will provide updated capital and exploration
     expenditure guidance for the 2021 financial year with our full year
     results.

.    An update on our short-term economic and commodities outlook is included
     on pages 4 to 5.

                                                           the prior quarter.

Energy coal (Mt) .............       23              6     Higher production at NSWEC was offset by lower volumes at Cerrejon as a
                                    (16%)           (2%)   result of a temporary shutdown in response to COVID-19.

                   the year ended 30 June 2020

Summary

BHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry:

“BHP safely delivered a strong operational performance in the 2020 financial year, achieving record 
production in a number of our operations, and an improved cost base. This performance, achieved in 
the face of COVID-19 and other challenges, is a result of the outstanding effort of our people and 
the support of our communities, governments, customers and suppliers. We have sought to support those 
who rely on BHP through the pandemic with increased hiring, shorter payment terms for small, local 
and indigenous suppliers, support for contract workers and community funding for health and social 
services. 

Our diversified portfolio and high quality assets, together with our strong balance sheet, make us 
resilient to the ongoing uncertainty in the markets for our commodities. We expect to continue to 
generate solid cash flow through the cycle and we remain confident in the outlook for demand for 
our products over the medium to long-term. We continue to focus on becoming even safer, delivering 
exceptional operational performance, maintaining disciplined capital allocation, creating and 
securing more options in future facing commodities and building social value. We have learned new 
ways of working, both internally and with others, through the COVID-19 pandemic. We will seek to 
embed these in a way that helps to reinforce these priorities.”

Major development projects

During the year, the BHP Board approved the Ruby oil and gas project in
Trinidad and Tobago. At the end of the 2020 financial year, BHP had six major
projects under development in petroleum, copper, iron ore and potash, with a
combined budget of US$11.4 billion over the life of the projects. Our major
projects under development in petroleum and iron ore are tracking to plan.

The Spence Growth Option is continuing to progress, however, as a result of
measures put in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19, first production is now
expected between December 2020 and March 2021. As a result of the reduction of
the on-site workforce, the commissioning of the desalination plant and
capitalisation of the associated US$600 million lease (approximate) will now
occur in the first half of the 2021 financial year.

In June 2020, final shaft lining work for the Jansen project, which was reduced
to focus on one shaft as part of our COVID-19 response plan to reduce our
on-site interprovincial workforce, was resumed in both shafts. 
Timing for completion of the shafts continues to be under review. BHP continues to
assess the impacts of COVID-19 and the temporary reduction in construction
activity.

COVID-19 update

During the June 2020 quarter, our operated assets have continued with additional 
protocols in place to protect our workforce and communities from the spread of 
COVID-19, in line with guidelines from local and federal government bodies and 
expert health advice in the geographies where we operate. 

In Australia, we have only had a small number of cases among our workforce since 
COVID-19 began, none with workplace exposure, and some assets are returning to 
more normal rosters. We remain vigilant and will continue with social distancing 
and hygiene practices and other protocols as appropriate to minimise the risk of 
transmission. 

In South America, COVID-19 infection rates have seen governments continue with 
travel and lockdown restrictions. We continue to operate with a reduced number 
of people at mine sites and other operational facilities, with only business 
critical personnel on site. We have implemented a comprehensive plan for COVID-19 
including various hygiene and health controls and a proactive testing regime for 
people before entering sites and boarding transportation. 

In addition, we have implemented a company-wide COVID-19 app for employees and 
contractors so that in the event of a positive result, movement on site can be 
tracked to trace others who may have been in contact, and targeted isolation and 
sanitation can be undertaken. Medical and wellbeing support is in place for the 
workforce. 

Our supply chains remain open and we have adequate supplies to operate and maintain 
critical equipment, with alternative suppliers identified for many of these.


Marketing update/(2)/

Short term economic outlook

The global economy has been dramatically impacted by COVID-19. Many major
economies contracted heavily in the June 2020 quarter, including the United
States (US), Europe and India. In contrast, China has moved from intensive
viral suppression to economic recovery. Much of the developing world is still
in the escalation phase of their COVID-19 outbreaks. The developed world has
begun to re-emerge from wave one lockdowns, but early indications are that
there is likely to be a period of uncertainty, with re-escalation of infection
rates and re-implementation of COVID-19 response measures in some jurisdictions.

The pace and scope of recovery will vary across countries. Where ""hibernation
policies""/(3)/ have been enacted, we anticipate a smoother resumption of
activity after the first wave. A considerable amount of monetary, liquidity and
fiscal policy support has been mobilised in response to COVID-19. It is still
uncertain how significant the multiplier effect will be of the monetary and
fiscal stimulus policies measures that have been taken. A lower multiplier
could result from depressed consumer and business confidence due to the impact
of COVID-19 on both jobs and profitability. A higher multiplier could occur if
the lagged impact of stimulus coincides with the release of pent-up demand as
economies emerge from the lockdown, with the caveat that major second waves do
not occur.

The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) latest forecasts predict that the world
economy will contract by 4.9 per cent in the 2020 calendar year and rebound by
5.4 per cent in the 2021 calendar year. While we plan against a range, our base
case is similar across the two years. If this case eventuated, the world
economy would be around 6 per cent smaller, on average, in the 2021 calendar
year than it would otherwise have been if COVID-19 had not occurred.

Regionally, we note that Chinese domestic industrial activity has been
improving, spurred on by supportive credit and fiscal policy. The major risk to
maintaining that positive trajectory is the possibility of a widespread second
wave of infections emerging. That is among the range of pathways that we
consider and it is the key uncertainty in each of our regional outlooks.
Elsewhere, indications are that the US, India, Japan and Europe will all
experience a flatter recovery trajectory than China. Negative feedback loops to
China from the downturn in the rest of the world are factored in to our range
analysis.

Short term commodities outlook

Exchange traded commodity prices have recovered slightly from their March/April
2020 lows. Bulk commodity prices have diverged, with iron ore higher than in
April 2020 while metallurgical coal prices are lower. Across the suite of
commodities, a combination of economic supply-side curtailments and COVID-19
induced supply-side disruptions have served as a partial offset to the lower
demand.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   BHP Operational Review for                4
                   the year ended 30 June 2020

We maintain our view that steel production ex-China could contract by a
double-digit percentage in the 2020 calendar year. We estimate that capacity
utilisation ex-China fell to between 50 and 60 per cent across the June
quarter. Steel makers from other regions, including Europe, the Americas, India
and Japan have cut production. This reflects logistical difficulties created by
COVID-19 (e.g. inter-state labour availability in India) as well as collapsing
demand in downstream industries, such as automotive (e.g. Europe and Japan).

In China, blast furnace utilisation rates have increased from around 80 per
cent earlier in February 2020 to above 90 per cent in June 2020. Daily rebar
transactions were above normal seasonal levels for much of the June 2020
quarter, helping support a crude steel run-rate of 1,117 Mtpa in June 2020
(+4.5 per cent year-on-year). Year-to-date annualised production of 1,004 Mt is
broadly consistent with our base case. Finished inventories have fallen as
downstream activity has improved. While we note that only about 10 per cent of
Chinese apparent steel demand/(4)/ is exported in finished products, the
weakness in global demand will weigh on Chinese flat products manufacturers.
However, better than expected outcomes for domestic machinery and auto
production have narrowed the gap between long and flat product performance seen
early in the year. Electric-arc furnace utilisation fell as low as 12 per cent
in February 2020, but has now recovered to normal seasonal levels around 70 per
cent. We continue to believe that if China can avoid a second wave of COVID-19,
steel and pig iron production can both rise in the 2020 calendar year versus
the prior year.

The Platts 62% Fe Iron Ore Fines price index has been resilient so far. This
reflects solid Chinese pig iron production of 935 Mtpa in June 2020 (+4.1 per
cent year-on-year), and the impact of constrained Brazilian exports. Meanwhile,
preliminary shipping data suggest Australian exports hit a record of 1,072 Mtpa
in June 2020. Weakness ex-China is less consequential for price formation in
iron ore than in other commodities.

The Platts Premium Low-Volatile Metallurgical Coal price index has been under
downward pressure through the June 2020 quarter. Negative demand impacts from
COVID-19 lockdowns in the major importing regions of Europe, India and
developed Asia have been the major influence on the market. Chinese demand, on
the other hand has been firm. However, China's coal import policy remains a key
uncertainty. As demand disruption ex-China accelerated early in the June
quarter, prices traded below the lows seen in the second half of the 2019
calendar year. They have since stabilised at these levels. The geographic
diversification of metallurgical coal demand is a long term advantage but an
impediment under today's unique circumstances. Developments in both supply and
demand imply that lower quality products may face headwinds for an extended
period. Premium coking coals exhibit attractive medium-term fundamentals.

The energy coal market is in a difficult state. The GCNewc 6000kcal price
recently fell below the levels reached during the 2015/16 downturn. Wood
Mackenzie has estimated that at late June 2020 spot prices around two-thirds of
seaborne supply was likely to be earning negative margins. Short term increases
in producer currencies and diesel prices have amplified cost challenges. An
uplift in power demand across developed Asia as re-starts progress could help
to stabilise the market. China's policy in respect of energy coal imports
remains a key uncertainty.

Copper prices fell sharply in March 2020 amidst depressed macro investor
sentiment. They have since rebounded, first on improving sentiment towards
pro-growth assets, and more recently on news of supply challenges in South
America due to COVID-19. In terms of demand fundamentals, our view is that the
decline in ex-China copper demand will be less severe than for steel.
Conversely, in China, copper demand could be marginally weaker than steel in
the 2020 calendar year, based partly on copper's greater exposure to indirect
exports from China (approximately 20 per cent versus approximately 10 per cent
for steel). Copper also benefits less than steel from transport and non-power
utilities infrastructure, which are benefitting from strong policy support. On
the supply side, Peru and Chile have experienced difficulty in containing
COVID-19, with flow-on impacts to copper operations and the broader supply
chain. This has led to a material tightening of the copper concentrate balance,
with treatment and refining charges moving lower in response. Scrap
availability has also been constrained.

After crashing in March 2020, crude oil prices exhibited considerable
volatility in April 2020. However, conditions improved in May and June 2020, as
the early impact of global supply cuts, China's demand recovery and activity
re-starts in the US and Europe took some pressure off global storage. Large and
small producers alike have announced sharp cuts in capital spending in response
to the price decline. In North America, rigs targeting oil have declined by
more than 70 per cent, to a level last seen before the shale boom. We believe
that the most significant risks to the physical market have passed. However, a
return to pre-COVID-19 demand levels is not expected to occur before the end of
the 2021 calendar year.

     accounted investments, third party product and internal sales, and
     represent the weighted average of various sales terms (for example: FOB,
     CIF  and CFR), unless otherwise noted. Includes the impact of provisional
     pricing and finalisation adjustments.
(ii) Includes internal sales.
(iii)Hard coking coal (HCC) refers generally to those metallurgical coals with
     a Coke Strength after Reaction (CSR) of 35 and above, which includes coals
     across the spectrum from Premium Coking to Semi Hard Coking coals, while
     weak coking coal (WCC) refers generally to those metallurgical coals with
     a CSR below 35.
(iv) Export sales only; excludes Cerrejon. Includes thermal coal sales from
     metallurgical coal mines.

The large majority of oil sales were linked to West Texas intermediate (WTI) or
Brent based indices, with differentials applied for quality, locational and
transportation costs. The large majority of iron ore shipments were linked to
index pricing for the month of shipment, with price differentials predominantly
a reflection of market fundamentals and product quality. Iron ore sales were
based on an average moisture rate of 7.5 per cent. The large majority of
metallurgical coal and energy coal exports were linked to index pricing for the
month of shipment or sold on the spot market at fixed or index-linked prices,
with price differentials reflecting product quality. The majority of copper
cathodes sales were linked to index price for quotation periods one month after
month of shipment, and three to four months after month of shipment for copper
concentrates sales with price differentials applied for location and treatment
costs.

At 30 June 2020, the Group had 304 kt of outstanding copper sales that were
revalued at a weighted average price of US$2.73 per pound. The final price of
these sales will be determined in the 2021 financial year. In addition, 322 kt
of copper sales from the 2019 financial year were subject to a finalisation
adjustment in the current period. The provisional pricing and finalisation
adjustments will increase Underlying EBITDA/(5)/ by US$125 million in the
2020 financial year and is included in the average realised copper price in the
above table.

Corporate update

In December 2019, BHP agreed to fund a total of US$793 million in financial
support for the Renova Foundation and Samarco. This comprises US$581 million to
fund the Renova Foundation until 31 December 2020 which will be offset against
the Group's provision for the Samarco dam failure, and a short-term facility of
up to US$212 million to be made available to Samarco until 31 December 2020.

We will provide an update to the ongoing potential financial impacts on BHP
Brasil of the Samarco dam failure with our full year Results Announcement on
18 August 2020. Any financial impacts will continue to be treated as an
exceptional item.

Petroleum - Total petroleum production decreased by 10 per cent to 109 MMboe,
with volumes marginally below guidance as a result of weaker than expected gas
demand due to the impact of COVID-19 and a decrease in tax barrels at Trinidad
and Tobago due to low commodity prices in the June 2020 quarter. Volumes are
expected to decrease to between 95 and 102 MMboe in the 2021 financial year,
reflecting expected lower gas demand in Eastern Australia and Trinidad and
Tobago, the previously announced delay of several small and medium sized
projects with short lifecycles and natural field decline across the portfolio.

Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production decreased by 11 per
cent to 49 MMboe due to the impacts of Tropical Storm Barry in the Gulf of
Mexico, Tropical Cyclone Damien at our North West Shelf operations, maintenance
at Atlantis and natural field decline across the portfolio. Weaker market
conditions, including impacts from COVID-19, also contributed to lower volumes
in the June 2020 quarter. This decline was partially offset by higher uptime at
Pyrenees following the 70 day dry dock maintenance program during the prior
year.

Natural gas production decreased by nine per cent to 360 bcf, reflecting a
decrease in both production and tax barrels (in accordance with the terms of
our Production Sharing Contract) due to weaker market conditions in Trinidad
and Tobago, impacts of maintenance and Tropical Cyclone Damien at North West
Shelf and natural field decline across the portfolio.

and gas markets and heightened risk of interruption to field activity, we have
reviewed our capital, operating, exploration and appraisal expenditure
programs. We will provide updated capital and exploration expenditure guidance
for the 2021 financial year with our full year Results Announcement to be
released on 18 August 2020.

Petroleum exploration

No exploration and appraisal wells were drilled during the June 2020 quarter.

The Deepwater Invictus rig is anticipated to mobilise to Trinidad and Tobago in
the September 2020 quarter to drill one exploration well, Broadside, in our
Southern licences as part of Phase 5 of our deepwater drilling campaign,
subject to any further COVID-19 constraints on mobilisation.

In the US Gulf of Mexico, following lease sale 254, blocks GC80 and GC123 were
awarded in July 2020 in the central Gulf of Mexico, building on our Green
Canyon position. Block GB721 was also awarded in June 2020, expanding our
western Gulf of Mexico position. As previously announced, we are the apparent
high bidder on Blocks AC36, AC80, AC81 in the western Gulf of Mexico. We are
completing prospect maturation of the Green Canyon blocks we acquired in the
recent lease sales, with plans to drill an exploration well during the 2021
calendar year.

In the Gippsland Basin, we participated in a multi-client 3D seismic survey
(non-operated)/(6)/ which is expected to be completed in the September 2020
quarter.

Petroleum exploration expenditure for the 2020 financial year was
US$564 million, of which US$394 million was expensed.

Copper - Total copper production increased by two per cent to 1,724 kt.
Production of between 1,480 and 1,645 kt is expected in the 2021 financial year.

For the majority of the June 2020 quarter, our Chilean assets operated with a 
reduction in their operational workforces of approximately 35 per cent to 
incorporate measures in response to COVID-19. We have implemented a comprehensive 
plan for COVID-19 including various hygiene and health controls and a proactive 
testing regime for people before entering sites and boarding transportation. 
The operating environment across our Chilean assets is likely to remain challenging, 
with reductions in our workforce expected to remain at a similar level during 
the September 2020 quarter.

Escondida copper production increased by four per cent to 1,185 kt, with record 
June 2020 quarter concentrator throughput of 382 ktpd lifting annual concentrator 
throughput to a record 371 ktpd. This offsets the impact of a three per cent decline 
in copper grade, stoppages associated with the social unrest in Chile (7 kt impact) 
and a reduced workforce due to COVID-19 preventative measures. The new records were 
achieved through continued improvements in operational and maintenance practices 
leading to increased availability and utilisation at the site’s three concentrators. 
Production of between 940 and 1,030 kt is expected for the 2021 financial year, with 
a decline in copper grade of concentrator feed approximately four per cent. Lower 
volumes reflect the need to continue to balance mine development and production 
requirements, with processing capacity at concentrators and leaching plants, as a 
result of a reduced operational workforce due to COVID-19. It is expected that 
production levels are likely to be impacted in the 2022 financial year as a result 
of reduced operational workforce and material movement in the 2021 financial year. 
Guidance of an annual average of 1,200 kt of copper production over the next five 
years remains unchanged. 


Pampa Norte copper production decreased by two per cent to 243 kt, with strong
operating performance offset by grade decline of approximately 14 per cent.
Production for the 2021 financial year is expected to be between 240 and 270 kt,
reflecting the reduced operational workforce due to COVID-19, the start-up of
the Spence Growth Option project and expected grade decline of approximately
seven per cent. On 1 July 2020, Cerro Colorado announced it had started a
four-month process to adjust its mine plan to reduce throughput and costs to
achieve improved cash returns and ensure viable mining operations for the
remaining period of its current environmental licence, which expires at the end
of the 2023 calendar year.

Olympic Dam copper production increased by seven per cent to 172 kt supported by
solid underground mine performance with strong development metres achieved,
record grade and the prior period acid plant outage. This was partially offset
by the impact of planned preparatory work undertaken in the September 2019
quarter related to the replacement of the refinery crane and unplanned downtime
at the smelter during the March 2020 quarter. The physical replacement and
commissioning of the refinery crane is expected to be completed in the March
2021 quarter. Underground development into the Southern Mine Area progressed to
plan over the year, and provided access to higher copper grade ore. Following
strong mine development over a number of years, we plan to draw down surplus
run-of-mine stockpiles. Production for the 2021 financial year
is expected to increase to between 180 and 205 kt. Production for the 2022
financial year is expected to be lower as a result of the major smelter
maintenance campaign planned for the first half of the year.

Antamina copper production decreased by 15 per cent to 125 kt and zinc
production decreased by 10 per cent to 88 kt, reflecting lower copper head
grades and the impacts of operating with a reduced workforce and a six-week
shutdown during the June 2020 quarter in response to COVID-19. Antamina is
ramping back up and will continue to operate with a reduced workforce, which
will impact material mined in the 2021 financial year. Copper production of 
between 120 and 140 kt and zinc production of between 140 and 160 kt is 
expected for the 2021 financial year

result of measures put in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19, first
production is now expected between December 2020 and March 2021. The
commissioning of the desalination plant and capitalisation of the associated
US$600 million lease (approximate) will now occur in the first half of the
2021 financial year.

Iron ore - Total iron ore production increased by four per cent to a record 248
Mt (281 Mt on a 100 per cent basis). Production of between 244 and 253 Mt (276
and 286 Mt on a 100 per cent basis) is expected in the 2021 financial year. We
continue with our program to improve productivity and provide a stable base for
our tightly coupled supply chain and this includes a major maintenance campaign
on car dumper three planned for the September 2020 quarter, with a corresponding
impact expected on production.

WAIO achieved record production, with higher volumes reflecting record
production at Jimblebar and Yandi. Weather impacts from Tropical Cyclone Blake
and Tropical Cyclone Damien, were offset by strong performance across the supply
chain, with significant improvements in productivity and reliability following a
series of targeted maintenance programs over the past four years. This enabled
WAIO to produce at a record annualised run rate above 300 Mt (100 per cent
basis) during the June 2020 quarter.

Consistent with our revised mine plan, the typical specification of Jimblebar
fines improved to above 60 per cent Fe grade in the June 2020 quarter.

WAIO continues to focus on operating safely and despite the de-escalation of
COVID-19 restrictions in Western Australia, a series of preventative measures
remain in place to minimise the spread of COVID-19. WAIO has returned to normal
shift rosters and has reopened the Perth office. To meet border controls
introduced by the Western Australian Government, over 900 employees and
contractors in business critical roles temporarily relocated to Western
Australia, including the majority of specialist roles who are based interstate,
such as train drivers and train load out operators. These employees remain in
Western Australia.

Mining and processing operations at Samarco remain suspended following the
failure of the Fundao tailings dam and Santarem water dam on 5 November 2015.
Operation readiness activities for Samarco's restart have been slowed as a
result of a reduced workforce, as part of the COVID-19 response. Restart can
occur when the filtration system is complete and Samarco has met all necessary
safety requirements, and will be subject to final approval by Samarco's
shareholders.

       Energy coal (kt).............. 23,167   5,654   (16%)   (24%)    (2%)

Metallurgical coal - Metallurgical coal production was down three per cent to 41
Mt (73 Mt on a 100 per cent basis) as a result of significant wet weather events
in the prior quarter and geotechnical constraints at South Walker Creek.
Production is expected to be between 40 and 44 Mt (71 and 77 Mt on a 100 per
cent basis) in the 2021 financial year, a similar level to the prior year as it
reflects an expected deterioration in market outlook due to the impact of
COVID-19. With Blackwater returning to full capacity towards the end of the
September 2020 quarter after flooding in the March 2020 quarter, volumes will be
weighted to the second half of the financial year.

At Queensland Coal, strong underlying operational performance, including record
underground coal mined at Broadmeadow and record annual production at Caval
Ridge and Poitrel, was offset by planned major wash plant shutdowns in the first
half of the year and significantly higher rainfall during January and February
2020 compared with historical averages. Blackwater, our largest mine, was the
most severely impacted, with mining operations stabilised during the June 2020
quarter and a return to full capacity expected towards the end of the September
2020 quarter.

Energy coal - Energy coal production decreased by 16 per cent to 23 Mt.
Production is expected to be between 22 and 24 Mt in the 2021 financial year.
Further potential impacts from COVID-19, including weak demand, represent
possible downside risk to the 2021 financial year guidance.

NSWEC production decreased by 12 per cent to 16 Mt as a result of the change in
product strategy to focus on higher quality products and unfavourable weather
impacts from December 2019 to February 2020. This was partially offset by a
strong performance in the June 2020 quarter driven by record truck utilisation.
Production is expected to be between 15 and 17 Mt in the 2021 financial year.

Cerrejon production decreased by 23 per cent to 7 Mt due to a temporary shutdown
during the June 2020 quarter in response to COVID-19, as well as a focus on
higher quality products, in line with the mine plan. The temporary shutdown
lasted for approximately six weeks and allowed for completion of COVID-19
control measures to meet the Colombian Government's regulations. 
Production is expected to be approximately 7 Mt in the 2021 financial year.

Nickel - Nickel West production decreased by eight per cent to 80 kt due to the
major quadrennial maintenance shutdowns at the Kwinana refinery and the
Kalgoorlie smelter, as well as planned routine maintenance at the concentrators,
in the December 2019 quarter. Operations ramped back up to full capacity during
the March 2020 quarter and ran at full capacity during the June 2020 quarter.
With the major planned maintenance and the transition to new mines now complete,
total nickel production is expected to increase to between 85 and 95 kt in the
2021 financial year.

Operations Services - In Australia, we have created 2,800 permanent jobs, with
Operations Services deployed at 20 locations across WAIO, Queensland Coal and
NSWEC and successfully accelerating safety, productivity and efficiency
outcomes. In May 2020, Operations Services launched a new national training
program to be delivered through the BHP FutureFit Academy which has been
developed to provide a customised training pathway, utilising nationally
recognised curricula for trade apprenticeships and maintenance traineeships. The
first two FutureFit Academy campuses opened in Mackay in Queensland and Perth in
Western Australia, with students to graduate and be deployed to an Operations
Services Maintenance team from the 2021 calendar year.

Minerals exploration

Minerals exploration expenditure for the 2020 financial year was US$176 million,
of which US$123 million was expensed. Greenfield minerals exploration is
predominantly focused on advancing copper targets within Chile, Ecuador, Mexico,
Peru, Canada, South Australia and the south-west United States.

At Oak Dam in South Australia, the third phase of the drilling program was
completed in the June 2020 quarter, bringing the total area drilled to
approximately 21,500 m and the results are currently being analysed. This
follows encouraging results from the previous drilling phases, which confirmed
high-grade mineralised intercepts of copper, with associated gold, uranium and
silver.

In June 2020, BHP agreed to acquire the Honeymoon Well development project and a
50 per cent interest in the Albion Downs North and Jericho exploration joint
ventures from MPI Nickel Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Norilsk Nickel
Australian Holdings BV. BHP is currently a 50 per cent shareholder in the Albion
Downs North and Jericho Joint Ventures. The combined tenement package is located
in the northern Goldfields region of Western Australia, approximately 50 km from
our Mt Keith mine and 100 km from the Leinster concentrator. Completion of the
agreement is subject to a number of conditions including government and third
party approvals.

NEWS RELEASE
Release Time       IMMEDIATE
Date               17 June 2020
Release Number     06/20


David Lamont appointed Chief Financial Officer

BHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry, today announced the appointment of David
Lamont as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of BHP, effective 1 December 2020. As
CFO, Mr Lamont will also join BHP’s Executive Leadership Team.

Mr Lamont has been the CFO of the ASX-listed global biotech company CSL Limited
since January 2016. Prior to joining CSL, Mr Lamont was the CFO and an Executive
Director at MMG from 2010. He previously served as CFO for several other
multinational public companies across a range of industries, including OZ Minerals
Limited, PaperlinX Limited and Incitec Pivot Limited.

Mr Lamont also held senior roles at BHP between 2001 and 2006, including CFO of
the company’s Carbon Steel Materials and Energy Coal businesses. He began his
career as an accountant at Deloitte.

Peter Beaven will continue as CFO until 30 November 2020 to provide ongoing
leadership through to Mr Lamont’s commencement, and will support Mr Lamont with
handover into early 2021, after which he will leave BHP.

Mr Henry said: “David has built a strong track record of financial management with
publicly traded multinational organisations over many years. He will bring broad
global experience across a diverse range of industries, including mining, deep
financial knowledge and a clear focus on delivering strong results for the company
and shareholders. I welcome David to BHP and look forward to him joining the team.”

“I want to thank Peter Beaven for both the significant contribution he has made to
BHP and the support and friendship he has shown me over many years. His
leadership, passion for continuous improvement and strategic approach have made
BHP safer, more sustainable and more valuable.

“In his current role, Peter has developed and embedded our rigorous approach to
capital allocation that instilled a strong culture of value and returns throughout the
organisation. During his time as CFO, the company’s financial position significantly
strengthened, our project portfolio became more value focused and our functions
more efficient while shareholders benefited from record cash returns. Peter also
spent ten years in major operational roles, including leading our copper business
where he oversaw record throughput at Escondida and completion of several major
projects that have set our Chilean operations up for sustained success.

“Having decided to pursue his own personal ambitions, Peter committed last financial
year to support BHP through the transition from Andrew Mackenzie to a new CEO.
His support has been invaluable to me as I have transitioned into the role. I thank him
on behalf of employees across BHP, the leadership team, the Board and our
shareholders.”

Mr Lamont said: “I am delighted to rejoin one of the best companies in the world.
BHP has strong values and a robust financial position, making this an exciting
opportunity to be part of a team that can generate returns to shareholders over the
long term and make a positive difference to local communities and global markets. I
look forward to working with Mike and the team.”

Mr Lamont holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree, is a qualified Chartered
Accountant and is a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants (Australia) and
a Director of Financial Executives Institute of Australia.

                     FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2020

Note: All guidance is subject to potential impacts from COVID-19 during the June
2020 quarter.

.    Our highest priority is the safety, health and wellbeing of our workforce
     and communities. We have taken action to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

.    Our financial position is strong. Underpinned by our low-cost operations,
     our business is resilient and expected to continue to generate solid cash
     flow.

.    Strong underlying operational performance across the portfolio offset the
     impacts of planned maintenance, natural field decline and wet weather in
     Australia. Group copper equivalent production was broadly unchanged over
     the nine months ended March 2020, with volumes for the full year now
     expected to be in line with last year.

.    Record production was achieved at Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) and
     Caval Ridge, while record average concentrator throughput was delivered at
     Escondida and record ore was stacked at Spence.

.    Production guidance for the 2020 financial year remains unchanged for
     petroleum, iron ore and metallurgical coal. Copper guidance for our
     operated assets is broadly unchanged and Antamina guidance is under review
     following temporary suspension of operations due to COVID-19. Energy coal
     production guidance is under review with Cerrejon placed on temporary care
     and maintenance due to COVID-19.

.    Full year unit cost guidance/(1)/ remains unchanged for the 2020 financial
     year.

.    Our major projects under development in petroleum and iron ore are tracking
     to plan. As a result of measures put in place to reduce the spread of
     COVID-19, the Spence Growth Option schedule and timing for completion of
     the shafts at Jansen are under review.

.    We have flexibility in our capital and exploration expenditure. We are
     reviewing our guidance for the 2021 financial year and it will be lower
     than the current guidance of around US$8 billion.  We will provide updated
     guidance with our full year results.

.    An update on COVID-19 measures and our short-term economic and commodities
     outlook is included on pages 3 to 5.

Copper (kt) ..................    1,310            425     Lower production at Escondida due to the impact of expected lower copper
                                      5%            (7%)   grades, partially offset by continued strong concentrator throughput.
                                                           Lower volumes at Olympic Dam due to unplanned downtime at the smelter.

Iron ore (Mt) ................      181             60     Production was broadly flat at WAIO despite weather impacts from

Summary

BHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry:

""We have operated safely for the quarter and have achieved another strong
operational performance.

We have implemented extensive measures across our operations to keep our people
and communities safe from COVID-19. Working closely with relevant authorities
and medical experts, strict travel and working practice arrangements have been
established, including deferral of non-critical activity on our operating sites
to support social distancing, revised rosters to reduce people travelling to
site, more intensive site cleaning and health checks. I am encouraged to know
that the small number of colleagues from our 72,000 strong global workforce who
have tested positive for the virus have recovered or are recovering well.

The coupling of our disciplined controls, the commitment of people across BHP,
and our financial strength has enabled us to continue to safely operate and
supply our customers with the critical resources they require, and to continue
to provide jobs and an underpinning of economic activity both locally and around
the world. We have accelerated payments to many of our suppliers and have
established COVID-19 relief funds to help our communities and local health and
social services. BHP is committed to playing its part in the collective, global
response to this pandemic. Our business continuity plans have been effective and
our operations have continued to perform well, thanks to the effort of our
employees, contractors and suppliers. We have delivered strong performance
across the portfolio despite the impacts of planned maintenance, natural field
decline and wet weather in Australia. Western Australia Iron Ore achieved record
year-to-date production, while Escondida production also increased supported by
record concentrator throughput.

While demand in China has strengthened in recent weeks, we expect other major
economies, including the US, Europe and India, to contract sharply in the June
2020 quarter. The situation remains fluid, however, with our strong financial
position and low-cost operations, our business is resilient, with capacity to
generate solid cash flow through this period and emerge well placed as the
global economy recovers.

Our priorities are the continued safety of our people, continuing reliable 
operations and supporting our customers, suppliers and communities in these challenging times.""

                   the nine months ended 31 March 2020

Major development projects

At the end of March 2020, BHP had six major projects under development in
petroleum, copper, iron ore and potash, with a combined budget of US$11.4
billion over the life of the projects. Our major projects under development in
petroleum and iron ore are currently tracking to plan and are subject to
potential impacts from COVID-19.

The Spence Growth Option is continuing to progress, however the schedule is
under review with first production potentially a few months later than December
2020 as a result of the measures taken to facilitate social distancing
protocols. First production is still expected to be in the 2021 financial year.

In March 2020, final shaft lining work at Jansen for two shafts was reduced to
focus on one shaft at a time, with reduced crews. This reduction in activity was
taken as part of our COVID-19 response plan and was aligned with the Provincial and
Federal Government of Canada's emergency measures for COVID-19. It reflects a
reduction in the number of contractors and in the need for out-of-Province
workers on site. Timing for completion of the shafts continues to be under
review. BHP will continue to assess the impacts of COVID-19 and the temporary
reduction in activity.

COVID-19 update on operations

At this time, among our global workforce of 72,000 people, BHP has had a small
number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, all of whom have either recovered or are
recovering well. Our protocols have functioned effectively and there has not
been any transmission from these individuals to co-workers.

BHP has taken action to help keep its people, their families and communities
safe. Strict health and travel guidelines have been put in place to reduce the
spread of COVID-19. While each of our operated sites is different, these measures include:

.    Reduced number of people at mine sites and other operational facilities to
     business critical employees and contractors only.

.    Changed rosters to reduce workforce movements. In addition, some
     non-residential workers have temporarily relocated to the jurisdiction of
     operation to meet tighter border controls.

.    Regular health screenings and temperature checks for workers, for example
     before boarding planes or buses and when entering sites.

.    Strong uptake of social distancing practices and changes to the way we
     travel to work, operate at work and run accommodation camps including
     hygiene practices and deep cleaning to reduce the risk of transmission.

.    Further information on the measures we have implemented is available at:
     bhp.com/covid-19.

We continue to monitor the situation and to update our measures based on advice
from country-specific health authorities and governments.

Our operations continue to run well. The changes we have put in place have
resulted in the deferral of non-critical activity. Our supply chains remain open
and we have adequate supplies to operate and maintain critical equipment, with
alternative suppliers identified for many of these.

Our financial position is strong. As at 31 December 2019/(2)/, net debt was
US$12.8 billion, at the lower end of our target range, and cash and cash
equivalents were US$14.3 billion. This strong position, combined with our
low-cost operations, means our business is resilient and expected to generate
solid cash flow through the cycle.

We are in a differentiated position to be able to continue to provide regional
jobs, products to customers and payments to suppliers. In doing so, we can help
underpin continued economic activity. We have accelerated payments to many of
our suppliers and established funds to help support regional and Indigenous
communities and health and community services. We are committed to playing our
part in the collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

                   the nine months ended 31 March 2020

Our strong position allows us to continue to invest through the cycle and we
have flexibility in our capital and exploration expenditure. We are reviewing
our capital and exploration guidance for the 2021 financial year and it will 
be lower than the current guidance of around US$8 billion.  We will provide
updated guidance with our full year Results Announcement to be released on
18 August 2020.

Marketing update/(3)/

Short term economic outlook

The global economy has been dramatically impacted by COVID-19. Many major
economies will contract heavily in the June 2020 quarter, including the United
States (US), Europe and India. In contrast, China has moved from intensive viral
suppression to early indications of economic recovery. The majority of heavy
industrial activity had restarted as of the end of March 2020, albeit with
considerable variation across provinces and sectors. We note that the developed
world in aggregate may have tentatively passed the peak in new COVID-19 cases
for wave one infections, while the developing world is unfortunately still in
the escalation phase/(4)/.

The arc of recovery will vary widely across countries. Where ""hibernation
policies""/(5)/ have been enacted, we anticipate a smoother resumption of
activity after the first wave than would otherwise have been the case. A
considerable amount of monetary, liquidity and fiscal policy support has been
mobilised in response to COVID-19. Early indications are that liquidity support
measures have been effective in dampening financial volatility. It is still
uncertain whether traditional monetary and fiscal stimulus policies will have
below-average or above-average multiplier effects. A lower multiplier could
result from depressed consumer and business confidence due to the deleterious
impact of COVID-19 on both jobs and profitability. A higher multiplier could
occur if the lagged impact of stimulus coincides with the release of pent-up
demand as economies wake from hibernation, with the important caveat that major
second waves are averted. Each is a plausible book-end for assessing where the
global economy might be as the 2021 calendar year approaches.

Chinese domestic industrial activity has been improving, spurred on by
supportive credit and fiscal policy. The major risk to maintaining that positive
trajectory is the possibility of a second wave of infections emerging. That is
among the range of pathways that we consider and it is the key caveat for each
of our regional outlooks. Indications are that the US and Europe will see a more
protracted period of activity disruption, a deeper labour market impact and a
flatter trajectory for the recovery once it arrives. India, Japan and South
Korea will see negative impacts on industrial activity from their own
suppression efforts and those of their trading partners. Negative
feedback loops to China from the downturn in the rest of the world are factored
in to our range analysis.

Short term commodities outlook

Exchange traded commodities have been sold rapidly down close to, or even
through, cash cost support. Bulk prices have been more resilient. Across the
portfolio, a combination of economic curtailments and COVID-19 induced
disruptions are a partial offset to the demand shock.

Based on our bottom-up analysis, informed by engagement with our customers, we
expect that steel production ex-China could contract by a double-digit
percentage in the 2020 calendar year. Steel makers from a variety of regions,
including Europe, the Americas, India and Japan have announced or signalled full shutdowns or
curtailments in the June 2020 quarter. This reflects both logistical
difficulties created by COVID-19 (e.g. inter-state labour availability in India)
as well as collapsing demand in downstream industries such as automotive (e.g.
Europe, where at one stage every major auto plant on the Continent was
constrained). Some of our customers are choosing to reduce production at their
blast furnaces in the face of this demand shock.

In China, blast furnace utilisation rates have increased from around 73 per cent earlier 
in the year to almost 79 per cent in April. Daily rebar transactions are now at or above normal seasonal
levels. Finished inventories are falling as downstream activity improves,
although the level is still very high relative to history. While we note that
only about 10 per cent of Chinese apparent steel demand/(6)/ is exported in
finished products (for example in excavators, ships or wind turbines), the depth
of the weakness in global demand will weigh on Chinese flat products
manufacturers. Electric-arc furnace utilisation fell as low as 12 per cent, but
has now recovered to 56 per cent. If China can avoid a second wave of COVID-19,
steel production may rise slightly in the 2020 calendar year.

The Platts 62% Fe Iron Ore Fines price index has been resilient to the COVID-19
shock so far. This outcome reflects solid Chinese pig iron production in the
year-to-date (1.7 per cent increase from last year), and a

                   BHP Operational Review for               4
                   the nine months ended 31 March 2020

continuation of the relatively soft seaborne supply picture that was in
evidence prior to the shock. Port outflows have been roughly 10 per cent higher 
year-on-year from March 2020 through mid-April 2020. Chinese
domestic production had fallen back to less than 190 Mtpa in February 2020, but
has since recovered to around 202 Mtpa. That compares to 211 Mtpa in December
2019. Chinese port stocks have declined consistently since February 2020, with
the latest weekly data showing an 18 per cent decline (26 Mt) year-on-year. Weakness
ex-China is less consequential for price formation in iron ore than in other
commodities, with China's 1.1 billion tonne import requirement set
against Japan's 120 Mt, Europe's 100 Mt and South Korea's 75 Mt, for example 
(all figures rounded).

The Platts Premium Low-Volatile Metallurgical Coal price index actually
increased during the first few weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak, partly reflecting
supply disruptions in China, Mongolia, Australia and elsewhere. However, as
COVID-19 began to spread to the major importing regions of Europe, India and
developed Asia, the demand side of the equation has begun to outweigh
constrained supply. As the velocity of demand disruption accelerated in late
March 2020 and early April 2020, prices have returned to the lows seen in the
second half of the 2019 calendar year. The geographic diversification of
metallurgical coal demand is a long term advantage but an impediment under
today's unique circumstances.

Copper prices fell sharply to levels close to cost support in March 2020 amidst
depressed macro investor sentiment. They have since stabilised a little above
the March lows. Our judgement, informed by our regular customer engagements, is
that the decline in ex-China demand will be less severe than for steel.
Conversely, in China, copper demand could be marginally weaker than steel in the
2020 calendar year, based partly on copper's greater exposure to indirect
exports (approximately 20 per cent versus approximately 10 per cent), although
recent trends within our customer base have been promising relative to top-down
expectations. On the supply side, evidence of both economic curtailments and
COVID-19 related disruptions have emerged. We note that marginal sources of
supply behaved quite rationally during the 2015/16 downturn, with a number of
smaller, higher cost operations across multiple continents choosing to
curtail/(7)/. Additionally, we observe that prices that are challenging for
higher cost mines are also associated with lower availability of scrap. This is
another mechanism whereby the copper market dynamically rebalances at times of
stress.

Crude oil fundamentals shifted abruptly in March 2020 as the result of
collapsing transport activity on the demand side and the unexpected flip of the
OPEC Plus grouping from supply discipline to a price war. After crashing in
March 2020, prices have exhibited considerable two-way volatility in April 2020,
with speculation of a grand bargain to curtail global supply offset by the
physical reality of the current glut. Notwithstanding the April 9 2020 agreement
by OPEC Plus to cut output by 10 MMbpd, with possibly more to come from G-20
producers, such is the scale of the demand loss that global storage capacity is
expected to be tested over coming weeks and months. It is possible that
differentials for inland crudes that are disadvantaged with respect to storage
availability will remain historically wide over this phase of market adjustment.
Large and small producers alike have announced sharp cuts in capital spending in
response to the price decline.

Petroleum - Total petroleum production decreased by 10 per cent to 82 MMboe.
Guidance for the 2020 financial year remains unchanged at between 110 and 116
MMboe, with volumes expected to be at the bottom of the guidance range.
Potential impacts from COVID-19, including weakness in customer demand, in the
June 2020 quarter represent possible downside risk to full year guidance.

Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production declined by 10 per cent
to 38 MMboe due to the impacts of Tropical Storm Barry in the Gulf of Mexico,
Tropical Cyclone Damien at our North West Shelf operations and natural field
decline across the portfolio. This decline was partially offset by higher uptime
at Pyrenees following the 70 day dry dock maintenance program during the prior
year.

Natural gas production decreased by 10 per cent to 270 bcf, reflecting a
decrease in tax barrels at Trinidad and Tobago in accordance with the terms of
our Production Sharing Contract, impacts of maintenance and Tropical Cyclone
Damien at North West Shelf, reduced domestic gas sales in Western Australia and
natural field decline across the portfolio.

COVID-19. These projects are tracking to plan and at this point, we do not
expect an impact on the timing of first production.

In light of the recent significant disruption to oil and gas markets and
heightened risk of interruption to field activity, we are reviewing our capital,
operating, exploration and appraisal expenditure programs, and where relevant,
together with our joint venture partners.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   BHP Operational Review for               7
                   the nine months ended 31 March 2020

While we are completing our five year plan, we can highlight the following
flexibility for the 2021 financial year:

.    The confirmed delay of the Scarborough gas development to the 2021 calendar
     year, as announced by Woodside (the operator) on 27 March 2020. A final
     investment decision by BHP is now expected to be approximately 12 months
     later than the original timing, which was from the middle of the 2020
     calendar year.

.    The potential deferral of approximately US$200 million non-committed
     exploration and appraisal expenditure in the 2021 financial year,
     representing approximately 30 per cent of the average annual exploration
     spend over the last two years.

.    In conjunction with joint venture partners, the potential delay of several
     small and medium sized projects with short lifecycles, to a time when we
     expect prices to be higher.

These actions will result in the deferral of production in the 2021 and 2022
financial years, however the reduction in capital projects across the sector may
provide the opportunity to further enhance the cost competitiveness of these
options.

Beyond these projects, our Petroleum growth portfolio includes many attractive
opportunities progressing through development studies and related activities,
which do not have material investment levels in the 2021 financial year,
including Trion and Trinidad and Tobago North.

We will provide updated capital and exploration expenditure guidance for the
2021 financial year with our full year Results Announcement released on 18
August 2020.

Petroleum exploration

No exploration and appraisal wells were drilled during the March 2020 quarter.

During the March 2020 quarter, the Deepwater Invictus rig completed regulatory
abandonment work on Shenzi appraisal and exploration boreholes and is currently
in the US Gulf of Mexico undergoing maintenance. The Deepwater Invictus rig is
anticipated to mobilise to Trinidad and Tobago in the middle of the 2020
calendar year to drill one exploration well, Broadside, in our Southern licences
as part of Phase 5 of our Deepwater drilling campaign, subject to any potential
COVID-19 constraints on mobilisation.

In the US Gulf of Mexico, we were the apparent high bidder on blocks GC80 and
GC123 in the central Gulf of Mexico, building on our Green Canyon position.
Additionally, we were the apparent high bidder on blocks AC36, AC80, AC81 and
GB721, which would expand our position in the western Gulf of Mexico.

Petroleum exploration expenditure for the nine months ended March 2020 was
US$405 million, of which US$246 million was expensed. A US$0.6 billion
exploration and appraisal program is being executed for the 2020 financial year
and reflects a reduction of US$0.1 billion from prior guidance as a result of
slightly later timing for the commencement of our Phase 5 Deepwater drilling
campaign in Trinidad and Tobago.

Copper - Total copper production increased by five per cent to 1,310 kt.
Guidance for the 2020 financial year is broadly unchanged for our operated
assets and reflects lower volumes at Olympic Dam. Guidance for Antamina is under
review due to impacts from COVID-19.

Escondida copper production increased by five per cent to 891 kt, supported by
record average concentrator throughput of 367 ktpd, which offset expected grade
decline. Strong concentrator throughput was driven by ongoing improvements in
maintenance and operational performance and was achieved despite Escondida
operating with a reduced headcount on site during March 2020. Guidance for the
2020 financial year remains unchanged at between 1,160 and 1,230 kt. Continued
improvements in concentrator throughput are expected to offset a reduction of
approximately five per cent in the copper grade of concentrator feed in the 2020
financial year versus the prior year.

Pampa Norte copper production increased by nine per cent to 188 kt, with record
ore stacked at Spence in the nine months to March 2020. Guidance for the 2020
financial year remains unchanged at between 230 and 250 kt, including expected
grade decline of approximately 10 per cent.

For the June 2020 quarter, our Chilean copper operations are expected to operate
with a reduction of more than 30 per cent in their operational workforces as we
have prioritised critical roles for operational continuity and incorporated a
series of planned preventative measures for COVID-19.

Olympic Dam copper production increased by eight per cent to 124 kt as a result
of the prior period acid plant outage, partially offset by the impact of planned
preparatory work undertaken in the September 2019 quarter related to the
replacement of the refinery crane and unplanned downtime at the smelter during
the March 2020 quarter. Production for the 2020 financial year is now expected
to be approximately 170 kt. The physical replacement of the refinery crane and
commissioning planned for commencement in the March 2020 quarter, has been
impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, and completion is now expected by the end of
the 2020 calendar year.

Antamina copper production decreased by three per cent to 107 kt and zinc
production decreased by one per cent to 75 kt, reflecting lower copper head
grades. During March 2020, Antamina operated with a reduced workforce in
response to COVID-19, before being given Government approval to demobilise the
workforce and then taking a decision on 14 April 2020 to temporarily suspend operations.
Timing on resuming operations at Antamina is uncertain and guiidance for the 2020 financial 
year is under review. The Peruvian state of emergency has been extended until 26 April 2020.

The Spence Growth Option is continuing to progress, however the schedule is
under review with first production potentially delayed until early in the 2021
calendar year as a result of lower headcount on site, reflecting the decision to
reduce the occupancy at the construction camp, to facilitate social distancing
protocols. As a result of the reduction of the on-site workforce, the
commissioning of the desalination plant could potentially be delayed a few
months until the first

Iron ore - Total iron ore production increased by three per cent to 181 Mt (205
Mt on a 100 per cent basis). Guidance for the 2020 financial year remains
unchanged at between 242 and 253 Mt (273 and 286 Mt on a 100 per cent basis).

WAIO achieved record production, with higher volumes reflecting record
production at Jimblebar and the impact of the train derailment in the previous
period. Weather impacts from Tropical Cyclone Blake and Tropical Cyclone Damien
were offset by strong performance across the supply chain, including improved
car dumper reliability, with completion of a major car dumper maintenance
campaign in October 2019, implementation of improved maintenance strategies, and
delivery of consistent performance across our mine operations. This strong
performance has resulted in healthy stock levels across our mines.

Consistent with our revised mine plan, Jimblebar fines Fe grade has improved
during the March 2020 quarter, with the typical specification expected to return
to above 60 per cent in the June 2020 quarter.

WAIO continues to focus on operating safely and has incorporated a series of
preventative measures to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. We have reduced the
number of workers on our sites, with those not critical to operations working
from home. To meet border controls introduced by the Western Australian
Government, over 900 employees and contractors in business critical roles have
been temporarily relocated to Western Australia, including the majority of
specialist roles who are based interstate, such as train drivers and train load
out operators.

Mining and processing operations at Samarco remain suspended following the
failure of the Fundao tailings dam and Santarem water dam on 5 November 2015.
Approval of the Corrective Operating Licence (LOC) for Samarco's operating
activities at its Germano Complex was received in October 2019. As a result of
precautions taken for COVID-19, operation readiness activities for restart have
been slowed, with only critical activities being undertaken. Restart can occur
when the filtration system is complete and Samarco has met all necessary safety
requirements, and will be subject to final approval by Samarco's shareholders.

   Metallurgical coal (kt).........    29,504   9,222      (3%)    (7%)   (16%)
   Energy coal (kt)................    17,513   5,788     (13%)   (14%)    (5%)

Metallurgical coal - Metallurgical coal production was down three per cent to 30
Mt (52 Mt on a 100 per cent basis). Guidance for the 2020 financial year remains
unchanged at between 41 and 45 Mt (73 and 79 Mt on a 100 per cent basis), with
volumes now expected to be at the lower end of the guidance range following
significantly higher rainfall during January and February 2020, by a factor of 
almost two at Peak Downs and almost three at Blackwater compared with historical averages. 
Potential impacts from COVID-19, including weak demand as a result of customer disruptions, 
in the June 2020 quarter, represent possible downside risk to full year guidance.

At Queensland Coal, strong underlying operational performance, was offset by
planned major wash plant shutdowns in the first half of the year and significant
wet weather impacts in the March 2020 quarter. Blackwater, our largest mine, 
was the most severely impacted, with five site evacuations
following the flooding of pits and haul roads during January and February 2020.
Mining operations at Blackwater are expected to be stabilised in the June 2020
quarter and to return to full capacity during the September 2020 quarter as
inventory levels are rebuilt. We are implementing further measures to reduce the
risk of COVID-19 and meet new restrictions on interstate travel, including
temporarily relocating workers and amending rosters to minimise travel within
Queensland, while further protecting the community and facilitating the
continuation of safe mining operations.

Energy coal - Energy coal production decreased by 13 per cent to 18 Mt. As a
result of actions by the Colombian Government to contain the spread of COVID-19,
a decision has been made to place Cerrejon on temporary care and maintenance,
and guidance for the 2020 financial year is now under review.

New South Wales Energy Coal production decreased by 13 per cent to 11 Mt as a
result of the change in product strategy to focus on higher quality products. In
addition, reduced air quality at our operations negatively impacted production
in December 2019 and January 2020, with wet weather further constraining
operations during February 2020. Guidance for the 2020 financial year remains
unchanged at between 15 and 17 Mt. The COVID-19 situation continues to be monitored with
preventative measures in place to protect the workforce, including reduced site
travel, social distancing practices and strict hygiene protocols.

Cerrejon production decreased by 12 per cent to 6 Mt mainly due to a focus on
higher quality products, in line with the mine plan. On 23 March 2019, following
the Colombian Government's declaration of a 15-day national quarantine to
contain the spread of COVID-19, a decision was made to ramp down operations at
Cerrejon and place it on temporary care and maintenance. Discussions about the
timing of production resumption are ongoing. Guidance for the 2020 financial
year is under review.

   Nickel (kt).....................      56.2    20.9      (4%)      9%     53%

Nickel - Nickel West production decreased by four per cent to 56 kt due to the
major quadrennial maintenance shutdowns at the Kwinana refinery and the
Kalgoorlie smelter, as well as planned routine maintenance at the concentrators,
in the December 2019 quarter. Operations ramped back up to full capacity during
the March 2020 quarter. With the transition to new mines underway, first ore was
achieved at Yakabindie, a new open-cut development at Mt Keith, during the
quarter. Production for the 2020 financial year is now expected to be 
lower than the 2019 financial year due to the extended shutdown. We continue to 
take action to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and safely conduct operations in 
compliance with strict health and travel guidelines, including the reduction in the 
number of people at our operational facilities and sites through flexible shifts.

Operations Services - In Australia, we have created over 2,000 permanent jobs,
with Operations Services deployed at 14 locations across WAIO, Queensland Coal
and NSWEC and successfully accelerating safety and productivity outcomes.

                                    infrastructure and utilities.

In March 2020, final shaft lining work at Jansen for two shafts was reduced to
focus on one shaft at a time, with reduced crews. This reduction in activity was
taken as part of our COVID-19 response plan and was aligned with the Provincial
and Federal Government of Canada's emergency measures for COVID-19 and reflects
a reduction in the number of contractors and the need for out-of-Province
workers on site. Timing for completion of the shafts continues to be under
review. BHP will continue to assess the impacts of COVID-19 and the temporary
reduction in activity.

Minerals exploration

Minerals exploration expenditure for the nine months ended March 2020 was US$124 million, 
of which US$89 million was expensed. Greenfield minerals
exploration is predominantly focused on advancing copper targets within Chile,
Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Canada, South Australia and the south-west United States.

At Oak Dam in South Australia, the third phase of the drilling program remains
on track to be completed in the June 2020 quarter. This follows encouraging
results from the previous drilling phases, which confirmed high-grade
mineralised intercepts of copper, with associated gold, uranium and silver.

                   the nine months ended 31 March 2020

Variance analysis relates to the relative performance of BHP and/or its
operations during the nine months ended March 2020 compared with the nine months
ended March 2019, unless otherwise noted. Production volumes, sales volumes and
capital and exploration expenditure from subsidiaries are reported on a 100 per
cent basis; production and sales volumes from equity accounted investments and
other operations are reported on a proportionate consolidation basis. Numbers
presented may not add up precisely to the totals provided due to rounding.
Copper equivalent production based on 2019 financial year average realised
prices.

The following footnotes apply to this Operational Review:

--------
(1) 2020 financial year unit cost guidance: Petroleum US$10.50-11.50/boe,
    Escondida US$1.20-1.35/lb, WAIO US$13-14/t, Queensland Coal US$67-74/t and
    NSWEC US$55-61/t; based on exchange rates of AUD/USD 0.70 and USD/CLP 683.
(2) The inclusion of derivatives (US$0.4 billion) and the application of IFRS 16
    Leases (US$1.9 billion) increased net debt by US$2.3 billion to US$12.8
    billion at 31 December 2019, compared to US$9.2 billion reported at 30 June
    2019. Figures exclude cash inflows and outflows since 31 December 2019,
    including the dividend payment of US$3.3 billion determined in respect of
    December 2019 half year paid on 24 March 2020. In addition, the Group has
    access to a US$5.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility. There are no
    covenants on our revolving credit facility.
(3) All data presented in this report is the latest available as of 13 April,
    2020.
(4) Based on global tracking activity conducted by Exante Data.
(5) The phrase ""economic hibernation"" was coined by ANU Professor's Tourky and
    Pitchford. It describes the comprehensive support that the public balance
    sheet can provide to mitigate the no-fault unemployment, default and
    insolvency that the effort to suppress a pandemic can bring.
(6) Incremental to apparent demand is around 35 Mt in direct net exports of
    steel.
(7) Wood Mackenzie documents 848 kt of annualised economic supply disruptions,
    from 36 operations, across the 2015 and 2016 calendar years.

     2019 half year, with volumes for the full year expected to be slightly
     higher than last year.

Mike Henry assumed the role of BHP Chief Executive Officer and Executive
Director on 1 January 2020.

BHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry, said: ""We delivered solid operational
performances across the portfolio in the first half of the 2020 financial year,
offsetting the expected impacts of planned maintenance and natural field
decline. Production and cost guidance is unchanged, and we remain on track to
deliver slightly higher production than last year. Our six major development
projects are progressing well, and we continue to advance our exploration
programs in petroleum and copper.""

      a CSR below 35.
(iv)  Export sales only; excludes Cerrejon. Includes thermal coal sales from
      metallurgical coal mines.

The large majority of iron ore shipments were linked to the index price for the month
of shipment, with price differentials predominantly a reflection of market
fundamentals and product quality. The large majority of metallurgical coal and energy
coal exports were linked to the index price for the month of shipment or sold
on the spot market at fixed or index-linked prices, with price differentials
reflecting product quality.

At 31 December 2019, the Group had 345 kt of outstanding copper sales that were
revalued at a weighted average price of US$2.80 per pound. The final price of
these sales will be determined over the remainder of the 2020 financial year.
In addition, 322 kt of copper sales from the 2019 financial year were subject
to a finalisation adjustment in the current period. The provisional pricing and
finalisation adjustments will increase Underlying EBITDA/(2)/ by US$16 million
in the 2020 financial year and is included in the average realised copper price
in the above table.

Corporate update

In November 2019, BHP approved US$44 million for BHP Brasil's share of the
funding for work related to the restart of one concentrator at Samarco. The
funding will enable the construction of a filtration plant and the commencement
of operation readiness activities. This follows the approval of the Corrective
Operating Licence (LOC) for Samarco's operating activities at its Germano
Complex in October 2019. Restart can occur when the filtration system is
complete and Samarco has met all necessary safety requirements, and will be
subject to final approval by Samarco's shareholders.

In December 2019, BHP agreed to fund a total of US$793 million in further
financial support for the Renova Foundation and Samarco. This comprises
US$581 million to fund the Renova Foundation until 31 December 2020 which will
be offset against the Group's provision for the Samarco dam failure, and a
short-term facility of up to US$212 million/(3)/ to be made available to
Samarco until 31 December 2020.

As at the date of this Operational Review, for the purpose of the December 2019
half year financial results, we are not in a position to provide an update on
the ongoing potential financial impacts on BHP Brasil of the Samarco dam
failure. Any financial impacts will continue to be treated as an exceptional
item.

Petroleum - Total petroleum production decreased by nine per cent to 57 MMboe.
Guidance for the 2020 financial year remains unchanged at between 110 and 116
MMboe, with volumes expected to be towards the lower end of the guidance range.

Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production declined by nine per
cent to 26 MMboe due to the impact of Tropical Storm Barry in the Gulf of
Mexico and natural field decline across the portfolio. This decline was
partially offset by higher uptime at Pyrenees following the 70 day dry dock
maintenance program during the September 2018 quarter.

Natural gas production decreased by eight per cent to 189 bcf, reflecting a
decrease in tax barrels at Trinidad and Tobago in accordance with the terms of
our Production Sharing Contract, maintenance at North West Shelf, reduced
domestic gas sales in Western Australia, and natural field decline across the
portfolio.

In Trinidad and Tobago, we completed the exploration program on our Northern
licences as part of Phase 4 of our deepwater drilling campaign. The Carnival-1
well was spud on 30 September 2019 and was a dry hole. The well was plugged and
abandoned on 13 October 2019. Development planning studies of the discoveries
in the North are ongoing. Following Carnival-1, the Deepwater Invictus rig
returned to the US Gulf of Mexico where it is currently completing regulatory
abandonment work on Shenzi appraisal and exploration boreholes.

During the December 2019 quarter, we extended our contract for the Deepwater
Invictus rig for an additional year through to May 2021 to support our ongoing
exploration activities.

As reported in the September 2019 Operational Review, we were the apparent
highest bidder on blocks GC124 and GC168 in Green Canyon in the central Gulf of
Mexico and on 18 additional blocks/(4)/ in the western Gulf of Mexico. All
leases were awarded by the Regulator in the December 2019 quarter.

Petroleum exploration expenditure for the December 2019 half year was
US$306 million, of which US$164 million was expensed. A US$0.7 billion
exploration and appraisal program is being executed for the 2020 financial year.

Copper - Total copper production increased by seven per cent to 885 kt.
Guidance for the 2020 financial year remains unchanged at between 1,705 and
1,820 kt.

Escondida copper production increased by four per cent to 602 kt, with record
average concentrator throughput of 367 ktpd for the half year, driven by
ongoing improvements in maintenance and operational performance under our
Transformation program. This offset expected grade decline and a 5 kt
concentrate production impact related to stoppages associated with the social
unrest in Chile. Including cathodes, the total production impact of the
stoppages is expected to be 7 kt for the 2020 financial year. The Escondida
Water Supply Expansion project was completed in December 2019, on schedule and
budget, further increasing total desalinated water capacity to 3,800 litres per
second. Guidance for the 2020 financial year remains unchanged at between 1,160
and 1,230 kt, with further improvements in concentrator throughput expected to
offset an approximately five per cent reduction in the copper grade of
concentrator feed versus the prior year.

Pampa Norte copper production increased by 18 per cent to 124 kt, reflecting
the impact of a fire at the electro-winning plant at Spence in the prior year.
Guidance for the 2020 financial year remains unchanged at between 230 and
250 kt, including expected grade decline of approximately 10 per cent.

Olympic Dam copper production increased by 32 per cent to 86 kt as a result of
the prior period acid plant outage, partially offset by the impact of planned
preparatory work undertaken in the September 2019 quarter related to the
replacement of the refinery crane. The physical replacement and commissioning
of the refinery crane is scheduled for the March 2020 quarter. Guidance for the
2020 financial year remains unchanged at between 180 and 205 kt.

Antamina copper production decreased by two per cent to 74 kt and zinc
production decreased by 22 per cent to 43 kt, reflecting lower copper and zinc
head grades, in line with the mine plan. Guidance for the 2020 financial year
remains unchanged at approximately 135 kt for copper and approximately 110 kt
for zinc.

Iron ore - Total iron ore production increased by two per cent to 121 Mt
(137 Mt on a 100 per cent basis). Guidance for the 2020 financial year remains
unchanged at between 242 and 253 Mt (273 and 286 Mt on a 100 per cent basis),
with a stronger second half performance expected in line with our plans.

At WAIO, higher volumes reflected record production at Jimblebar and the impact
of the train derailment in the December 2018 half year. This was partly offset
by a major car dumper maintenance campaign (completed on 16 October 2019) to
further improve port reliability and provide a stable base for our tightly
coupled supply chain. Mine operations continued to deliver consistent
performance.

Consistent with our revised mine plan, we expect Jimblebar fines Fe grade to
improve in the second half of the 2020 financial year, with the typical
specification returning to above 60 per cent in the June 2020 quarter.

Mining and processing operations at Samarco remain suspended following the
failure of the Fundao tailings dam and Santarem water dam on 5 November 2015.
Approval of the Corrective Operating Licence (LOC) for Samarco's operating
activities at its Germano Complex was received in October 2019 and operation
readiness activities for restart have commenced. Restart can occur when the
filtration system is complete and Samarco has met all necessary safety
requirements, and will be subject to final approval by Samarco's shareholders.

Metallurgical coal - Metallurgical coal production was down two per cent to 20
Mt (36 Mt on a 100 per cent basis). Guidance for the 2020 financial year
remains unchanged at between 41 and 45 Mt (73 and 79 Mt on a 100 per cent
basis), with a stronger second half performance expected in line with our plans.

At Queensland Coal, strong underlying operational performance at Poitrel, Peak
Downs, Caval Ridge and Broadmeadow was offset by planned major wash plant
shutdowns at Goonyella, Peak Downs and Caval Ridge, low opening raw coal
inventories at Blackwater, and truck and shovel underperformance at South
Walker Creek.

Energy coal - Energy coal production decreased by 12 per cent to 12 Mt.
Guidance for the 2020 financial year remains unchanged at between 24 and 26 Mt.

New South Wales Energy Coal production decreased by 11 per cent to 7 Mt as a
result of the change in product strategy to focus on higher quality products.
Smoke from regional bushfires and dust have reduced air quality at our
operations, which has impacted December 2019 production. We are monitoring the
situation and if air quality continues to deteriorate then operations could be
constrained further in the second half of the year. Guidance for the 2020
financial year remains unchanged at between 15 and 17 Mt.

Cerrejon production decreased by 13 per cent to 4 Mt as a result of a focus on
higher quality products, in line with the mine plan, and the impact of adverse
weather in the September 2019 quarter. Guidance for the 2020 financial year
remains unchanged at approximately 9 Mt.

Minerals exploration

Minerals exploration expenditure for the December 2019 half year was
US$84 million, of which US$67 million was expensed. Greenfield minerals
exploration is predominantly focused on advancing copper targets within Chile,
Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Canada, South Australia and the south-west United States.

Consistent with our focus on copper, in November 2019, BHP increased its
interest in SolGold Plc, the majority owner and operator of the Cascabel
porphyry copper-gold project in Ecuador, by 3.6 per cent to 14.7 per cent.

At Oak Dam in South Australia, the third phase of the drilling program
commenced in November 2019 and is expected to be completed in the June 2020
quarter. This follows encouraging results from the previous drilling phases,
which confirmed high-grade mineralised intercepts of copper, with associated
gold, uranium and silver.

Variance analysis relates to the relative performance of BHP and/or its
operations during the December 2019 half year compared with the December 2018
half year, unless otherwise noted. Production volumes, sales volumes and
capital and exploration expenditure from subsidiaries are reported on a 100 per
cent basis; production and sales volumes from equity accounted investments and
other operations are reported on a proportionate consolidation basis. Numbers
presented may not add up precisely to the totals provided due to rounding.
Copper equivalent production based on 2019 financial year average realised
prices.

BHP Board Update and Director Declaration

In accordance with UK Listing Rule 9.6.14, BHP Group Plc advises that Terry Bowen,
Director of BHP Group Plc and BHP Group Limited (BHP), has been appointed to the
Board of Transurban Group (Transurban) with effect from 1 February 2020.

We apply a 9 year tenure guideline as part of Director succession planning and
therefore, as planned, Lindsay Maxsted will not stand for re-election at the 2020 BHP
Annual General Meetings. As a consequence, there will be a limited period of overlap
between Terry Bowen and Lindsay Maxsted on the Boards of BHP and Transurban.

As planned, Terry Bowen has also been appointed as Chair of BHP's Risk and Audit
Committee, effective from 1 May 2020. Lindsay Maxsted will remain a member of the
Risk and Audit Committee until his retirement from the BHP Board at or before the
2020 Annual General Meetings.

Mr Bowen is currently a Managing Partner & Head of the Operations Group at BGH
Capital. Upon joining the Transurban Board, Mr Bowen will reduce his responsibilities
at BGH, transitioning to a part-time role as Partner and Chair of the Operations
Group.

 number of Performance Shares that

 Performance Shares that will vest will
 depend on the satisfaction of the
 applicable relative total shareholder
 return performance hurdle. If the
 performance hurdle is met the
 Remuneration Committee also
 conducts a holistic performance review
 at vesting time and has an overriding
 discretion under the Long Term
 Incentive Plan rules to reduce the
 number of Performance Shares that

Andrew Mackenzie retirement date 31 March 2020

The Board of BHP today announced that Andrew Mackenzie's retirement date will be
31 March 2020, three months earlier than previously announced on 14 November
2019. The Board, Mr Mackenzie and Mr Henry are confident that the CEO transition
is proceeding well and ahead of schedule, with Mike Henry assuming the role of
Chief Executive Officer from 1 January 2020, as previously announced.

Mr Mackenzie's retirement arrangements are summarised in the attached schedule.


Further information on BHP can be found at: bhp.com


Summary of revised terms of retirement for Andrew Mackenzie

1. Fixed remuneration

Andrew Mackenzie will continue to be employed by the Company until 31 March 2020 under the terms
of the 2019 remuneration policy. The Company will pay him a salary, make pension contributions and
provide usual other minor benefits until then. His base salary is US$1,700,000 per annum and pension
contributions are 25 per cent of salary for FY2020. Upon retiring, Mr Mackenzie will be entitled to receive
the accumulated value of funds under relevant pension plans, together with the value of any accrued
leave.

2. Severance payment

Mr Mackenzie will receive no severance payment, and no payment in lieu of notice.

3. Incentive arrangements

Mr Mackenzie's entitlements under the Cash and Deferred Plan (CDP), Short Term Incentive Plan
(STIP) and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) are governed by the shareholder-approved remuneration
policy, applicable plan rules and the Group's leaving entitlements policy as approved by shareholders
at the 2017 Annual General Meetings.

CDP
In relation to the FY2020 year, Mr Mackenzie will serve as CEO for six months. He will be considered
for a bonus under the CDP at the end of the year (i.e. for the year ended 30 June 2020). Whether any
bonus will be paid, and the amount, will be determined by the Remuneration Committee after an
assessment of the Company's and his personal performance after the year end. Accordingly, the
awards made under the CDP are ""at-risk"". Any amount assessed as payable will be reported in the
Remuneration Report that will be published in September. This is consistent with the remuneration
policy as approved by shareholders, and the established practice of the Company.
Even though Mr Mackenzie will be serving as an employee for nine months of the FY2020 financial
year, he will not receive any payment under the CDP for the last three months of that period. While the
CDP does allow the Remuneration Committee the discretion to make such a payment, in this case the
Remuneration Committee will not be using that discretion.

STIP
Under the rules of the STIP, unvested deferred shares are transferred to a retiring executive on the
originally scheduled vesting date.

LTIP
Mr Mackenzie is a participant in the LTIP approved by shareholders. The LTIP requires BHP to
materially outperform the comparator groups' Total Shareholder Return (TSR) for all the awards to
vest. The performance hurdles are stretching and ensure alignment with shareholders. Accordingly,
the awards made under the LTIP are ""at-risk"", and the actual value of any LTIP awards may ultimately
be zero. The Remuneration Committee reviews performance and takes advice from its independent
adviser before making any decisions about vesting. Importantly, even if the performance hurdle is met
the Committee conducts a holistic performance review at vesting time and has an overriding discretion
under the plan rules to reduce the amount of shares that vest.

Under the terms of the LTIP, employees who retire are entitled to hold awards granted previously.
However, the number of awards is reduced to reflect the period of service in relation to each grant.
They will vest only if the performance hurdle is met, and the Remuneration Committee confirms
vesting, at the expiration of the term. The actual value of the LTIP awards may ultimately be zero.

Mr Mackenzie's awards from 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 will therefore be pro-rated according
to the rules of the plan and in each case must be held for the full five years from the date of grant (see
the table below).

  A. STIP awards

The table below provides details of the STIP awards which will be unvested at the time of Mr
Mackenzie's departure. These shares represent half of the bonus paid under the STIP for FY2018
and FY2019 as approved by shareholders. They must be held for two years, which expire in 2020
and 2021, respectively.

  B. LTIP awards

The table below provides details of the LTIP awards that may vest in the five years after Mr
Mackenzie's departure.

As noted above, under the terms of the LTIP employees who retire are entitled to hold awards granted
prior to retirement. However, the number of awards is reduced to reflect the period of elapsed
employment service in relation to each grant. The pro-rata rule of the LTIP will thus impact the number
of awards Mr Mackenzie retains on departure. To determine the award Mr Mackenzie will retain on
departure, each individual award needs to be calculated on a pro-rata basis according to the time
worked over the five year performance period (e.g. if Mr Mackenzie had been employed for half of the
five year performance period then he would retain half the awards). The details of the awards Mr
Mackenzie will retain are set out below.

Whether the awards vest will depend on BHP's relative TSR performance over the five-year periods
to 30 June 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. In addition, even if the performance
hurdle is met the Committee conducts a holistic performance review at vesting time and has an
overriding discretion under the plan rules to reduce the amount of awards that vest. Accordingly, the
vesting outcome and the number of LTIP awards that will vest is unknown at this time.
